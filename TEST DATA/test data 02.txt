"two monkeys in a bath one says to the other haha the other says well put the coal tap on them how do you make a cat go woof pour petrol on it and light it these are the clean ones I was walking with

it looks like your wife&#39;s been in an accident I said I know but she&#39;s got cracking personality now here&#39;s a question you never hear a stand-up comedian ask why did you laugh at those jokes does anyone have any ideas on why they laughed I hate cats is a very good answer I&#39;m sure that&#39;s not the case though that&#39;s just another joke on top of that one so any ideas on why you laughed not nostalgia is it very good yeah cuz that old classic school jokes and the familiarity of that there&#39;s kind of a that&#39;s a reason sometimes any other thoughts breaking the ice well I suppose it is yeah that&#39;s social activity actually I think we&#39;re gonna talk about that later on the idea that laughter as a kind of group activity so panic we&#39;re gonna explain all this everyone does it everyone understands what it means but why actually is laughter laughter is more like a different way of breathing than it is anything else so what we&#39;re all doing right now hopefully is using the intercostal muscles the muscles between our ribs to get air in and out of our bodies so let&#39;s call metabolic breathing exactly breathe in you breathe out as being drawn in and then squeeze back out again do this so if we&#39;re I to look at your chest wall moving I&#39;d see I&#39;ve ever thought go on so my chest wall is just moving in and out you keep going with that you&#39;ve seen this almost sinusoidal movement this very smooth movement you start doing it the minute you&#39;re born that&#39;s it the whole rest of your life when we start laughing those same muscles start to contract they&#39;re really large deflections just squeezing air out of you and that&#39;s basically all laughter is it&#39;s an extremely primitive way of making a sound ultimately

stops you talking it&#39;s trying to kill you and we&#39;ve rigged some people up so we can show this exactly and what we&#39;ll notice is hopefully if you can make them laugh that both the very fine

The jokes about violence, animal abuse, and other insensitive topics are likely to be flagged by YouTube's advertiser-friendly content policies. This will severely impact monetization, as advertisers are unlikely to associate their brands with such material. The overall tone is highly inappropriate for a broad audience and could lead to demonetization or even content removal."

"Holy hell, this was far more difficult than I thought it was going to be I&#39;m going to take you on a journey where I try to beat GTA 5 whilst personally killing the fewest people possible So the rules are, I can&#39;t personally kill anyone If the game forces me to kill someone, I will kill them with melee If a required kill is impossible with melee I will use the weakest weapon that I have available I will also not use armour unless I can&#39;t progress without it I won&#39;t use any mods and I will play on the latest version of the game So at the end of each mission I will be able to tell you the minimum amount of melee and shots that you need to take to finish the mission So of course we start in prologue, which would have been very easy to do passively if Michael had kept his promise to Dave [Michael] You said you&#39;d clean the whole thing up back in North Yankton, [Dave] And you told me it&#39;d be a clean job No casualties But of course life is rarely that simple [Jaspers] Give it up! I got him! I saw your face I’ll remember you! Sadly, we rack up our first kill not 2 minutes into the game because this guy wanted to be a hero There is no way to avoid killing him [Michael] You didn’t have to do that! [Trevor] Let&#39;s get going There will be time for grieving later [Michael] Oh, f*ck you hear that? Sirens So problematically, for this challenge, the police arrive Now, I don&#39;t really care what you thought about Brad and Michael as gunmen before this point, because, trust me, they are far worse than you possibly ever could have imagined I was more expecting the police to die of old age than I was for Brad and Michael to actually kill anything [Michael] Let&#39;s get out of here Hooray! It only took ten f*cking minutes! Hooray! But of course, our problems aren&#39;t over More police arrive, and unfortunately, Michael and Brad don&#39;t understand a few things like basic tactics Line of sight, how to take cover, how to move forward, the basic sort of things you might want a criminal to know You got to give them credit, though It doesn&#39;t matter how far away the enemy is, they will still have a go, especially Brad With his shotgun I mean, Brad, look at how stoic he is He&#39;ll take 17 Shotgun shots to the chest and not even flinch That&#39;s b*lls So here we are, 15 minutes after we started the second section, I&#39;m assuming most of these cops died of old age But let&#39;s give some credit Michael and Brad maybe picked off one or two Unfortunately, we&#39;ve hit a little bit of a snag because this cop seems to be some kind of a demigod as he has now been shot 900 times and he&#39;s not dead yet Tired of waiting, I decided to start switching characters to relocate them to get better angles at this guy To quote a guard from Oblivion “Why won&#39;t you die?” [Michael] Come on, get to the driver What the hell killed him? He&#39;d been shot like, a hundred times in the last two minutes and he just suddenly falls over I don&#39;t even get to see what happened Least I get to progress though, but Jesus When Michael fell over here, I thought I was screwed I was like, “Oh, no, he&#39;s going to die” “He&#39;s on the ground bleeding” “I better switch to him” I was like, “Oh, sh*t, that didn&#39;t fix it oh no he’s fine” How the f*ck did Brad die? Seriously, Brad hits the ground so quickly that he leaves his shotgun in the air It&#39;s such a surprise So, unfortunately, we&#39;re back in phase one, but we are switching characters, so it will make things a bit easier However, the problem with moving these characters is that Trevor and Michael love these f*cking boxes I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a sexual thing or if they recognise the tactical advantage of having two boxes that can take thousands upon thousands of shots and not be destroyed But regardless, it&#39;s very annoying because wherever I move Michael or Trevor, the second I stop controlling them, they&#39;re going to run right back to those f*cking boxes [Michael] Let&#39;s get out of here Making progress got to phase two a lot quicker that time [Trevor] There aren’t many more cops in this town [Michael] This is f*cked man! The thing is blown! I got my share It&#39;s still wide open Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a candidate for the main character of GTA 6 Watch as this cop deletes Michael Well, f*ck So again, we&#39;re back at phase one, and we can add one more thing to the long list of things that Michael can&#39;t do He can&#39;t walk over small fences This was advantageous because putting Michael behind these fences gave him a much better line of sight to take out the cops And he couldn&#39;t ruin it by running back to those f*cking boxes [Trevor] Can&#39;t be many more cops in this town [Michael] This is f*cked man! So again, we&#39;ve reached the end of Phase two with this demigod of a cop with more HP than anything in the game Seriously, watch this He has his back to them He moves between them They&#39;re just nailing shots into him over and over again He will not- He hits him! He actually hits him! He won&#39;t die! He&#39;s just traversing the entire map And he will not die! This is the same guy that we killed in our first attempt who is now immortal! So I know he&#39;s killable because we killed him in the first attempt So I keep going, and suddenly I switch to Trevor, and he&#39;s on the ground Then something happens that I&#39;ve never seen before Trevor gets put into a sort of last stand animation, and it forces me to fire my gun So Trevor is on the ground for a grand total of 35 seconds What the hell? Then he suddenly loses a massive amount of HP, and I panic and switch away So I&#39;m thinking, “Oh, sh*t! Trevor&#39;s done for he&#39;s bugged” “He&#39;s going to die” “Oh no, he&#39;s fine nevermind” Having now spent 10 minutes playing, follow the leader all over this entire bloody map pumping round after round into this guy He manages to kill Michael We were so close! So close! After investigating for another hour, I concluded that this cop is likely only killedable by a player when he died last time, I was switching characters So more than likely, Trevor or Michael shot him, and the game considered me to have control of the character when the shot was fired, and thus it counted as a kill for me I am somewhat disappointed, but at least I get to hit this motherf*cker in the face [Michael] Come on! Get to the driver! So after downing the demigod with a glass jaw, the rest of this is kind of child&#39;s play Two more police show up, and they, of course, aren’t dissuaded by the fact that people who aren&#39;t me have killed a bunch of police around this area Now, that&#39;s job commitment Oh, no four more policemen Whatever am I going to do? Are you f*cking serious? Why the hell did it take them that little time to kill those cops? But so much time to kill the other cops What the hell? So we make our getaway and get confronted by no one else on this drive No, Brad why? You would have made such a more interesting character than Michael [Michael] I’m hit! Ah Jesus! T you got to get out of here! [Trevor] I ain’t gonna leave you Mikey! So it&#39;s time to leave, Mikey And fortunately, it&#39;s very easy to avoid the shootout Just run away Wait a second Michael survives? Wow! What a twist! Didn&#39;t see that one coming [Priest] But we know that you will show mercy to our friend Now, look, guys, I&#39;m not one to brag But, Pacifist%, world record! One hour, 58 minutes and 34 seconds Pretty good Now, let&#39;s compare this to my usual time during speedruns 6 minutes and 20 seconds I mean, it&#39;s pretty close, but let&#39;s be real Shooting at people unnecessarily is basically like cheating anyway So everyone else&#39;s times are invalid And I also have the speedrunning world record So that&#39;s it for part one Hopefully this video does well enough that I can make part two because it was pretty spectacular If you&#39;re interested in the giveaway that I&#39;m doing for 100 USD, the link will be in my comments But anyway, I hope you all are doing well ~ Interactions Reminder (Subscribe, Like, Comment) Removed ~ Back To Top"

"- This guy took a package from my porch and now he&#39;s about to open it in his car. But what he doesn&#39;t know is this is a custom built bait package that is recording him on four different cameras and it&#39;s about to unleash a pound of the world&#39;s finest glitter along with some other surprises. But to understand how we got to this point, first, we need to rewind a bit. About seven months ago, I noticed a package being reported as delivered, but it never arrived. So when I checked our security cameras I noticed this lovely couple out for a stroll. As you can see, they have backpacks on and they&#39;re just going around the neighborhood making an afternoon out of this. And if you&#39;ve ever been in a situation like this, you just sort of feel violated. And then I took this to the police and even with the video evidence, they said, it&#39;s just not worth their time to look into, so then you also feel powerless. And I just felt like something needs to be done to take a stand against dishonest punks like this. And then I was like, hold up, I built a dartboard that moves to get a bullseye every time. I spent nine years designing hardware that&#39;s currently roving around on another freaking planet. If anyone was going to make a revenge bait package and over-engineer the crap out of it, it was going to be me. So I started with a sketch and some CAD and then I hit up my buddy Sean, who is really good with this type of small electronics stuff and we got to work. Ultimately, when they opened the package, I just wanted to celebrate their choice of profession with a cloud of glitter because I mean, who doesn&#39;t love glitter? That&#39;s easy, I could just do that passively with like a spring when it opens. But I also wanted to record their reaction, and that&#39;s what makes the engineering here an order of magnitude more difficult. Because if you think about it, this thing has to sit on a porch all day and it can&#39;t be plugged in, and you have no idea when someone will come and pick this up. So it&#39;s not like you could just hit record on the camera and then put it in the box because you&#39;re gonna run out of battery and storage space. On top of that, I need some way to recover this footage in case I never get the bait package back. So after six months and lots of design iterations, and so much testing, here&#39;s where we landed. (upbeat music) This custom printed circuit board is the brains of the operation. It has a built-in accelerometer, and when it it&#39;s jostled it will check the GPS signal to see if it&#39;s been moved from the porch. And if so, it sends a signal to all the phones to wake up and start recording. And I&#39;m using four phones that have a wide angle filming mode and are angled back. And this 3D printed portion is contoured this way because it represents the field of view of the phones. So as you can see, I&#39;m guaranteed to capture their reaction no matter which way they open it from. And nestled in here, we&#39;ve got a can of fart spray. No joke, you can clear a room with one spray of this stuff. So we made a cam on a small motor that sprays it five times. And not only is this just a nice touch, but we keep repeating five sprays every 30 seconds, until they throw the package out of their car or house before they realize there&#39;s four phones inside. This increases our chances of finding it, because we always know the package location at all times due to the GPS on the phones. But even if we don&#39;t recover it, all four phones have LTE data plans. So they upload the footage to the cloud so I can still see what happened. And then for the pièce de résistance, we have a cup here on top that spins from a motor underneath. So once you load in a butt ton of the world&#39;s finest glitter, the motor spins really fast and the centrifugal force fires it evenly in all directions. Then we cut holes in the side of the lid and cover them with one-way film, so two of the cameras could see them as they walked away. And then finally, to make it look like an actual delivered package, we added some shrink wrap and a delivery label, which is perhaps my favorite part of the whole thing. Because if the thief wasn&#39;t in such a hurry, they&#39;d see that the package is actually coming from my childhood hero and in inspiration for this project, Kevin McCallister. (screams) - Yes. - I even looked up and am using the address of the actual house they filmed the movie in, and of course it&#39;s being shipped to his boys, Harry and Marv. And there&#39;s a charge port in the bottom because if it doesn&#39;t get stolen in any given day, I can bring it in and then recharge all the batteries in the system overnight. So the idea is the bad guy comes and takes it off your porch, then lifts the lid, and these two limit switches tell the circuit board brain inside that the lid&#39;s been removed and then that sets everything in motion. And I may be biased, but sometimes a well-engineered design is beautiful. (upbeat music) And because the phones have GPS, we created a virtual geofence around my house so I get a notification when the package has been moved off the property. So I put it down on the porch and now all that was left to do was wait. (clock ticking) Okay, so I was at work and I got a notification that the geofence we set up had been tripped. So then I checked the cameras and sure enough, the package is gone. So I checked the GPS and sort of tracked it and it appears they&#39;re in a car because they seem to leave my house pretty quickly, but it seems to have stopped in a parking garage, which is where I&#39;m headed to now. And if you&#39;re new here, this isn&#39;t a prank channel, so I am completely out of my comfort zone. (clock ticking) And there she is. Oh. Oh, I see some glitter. This is like recovering the black box of a crashed airplane. It would still work even if I didn&#39;t get the box back, the footage would upload to the cloud, but it&#39;s just faster to plug the phones in. So I&#39;m gonna go home and find out how this somehow ended up here. So it appears he was walking down the sidewalk and then suddenly makes a hard left. Then he takes the package and gets in his car and eventually makes it to this parking garage where this glorious sequence unfolds. - [Man] What the fhaaaaa- No way. (beep) Look at that, dude, look at my car, dude, everything. Oh my God, I don&#39;t know what this is. It&#39;s literally like everywhere. - [Man] Bro. (motor spinning) What the (beep) Come on. - [Thief] Bro, leave that (beep) outside. - [Man] What the (beep) is that smell (beep)? Open the door. (laughter) - [Man] What the (beep)? (motor spinning) - [Thief] Get that (beep) outta here, you shouldn&#39;t have even grabbed that (beep). - [Man] What the (beep)? - [Thief] Get that (beep) outta here. - [Man] What do you want me to do (beep)? - [Thief] Throw it away. That stinks. - [Man] You (beep) on yourself? Take this (beep) up out of here, (beep), for real. Oh. Take that (beep). Take the whole thing. (motor spins) - [Voice] Keep the change you filthy animal. (motor spinning) - [Mark] So the moral of the story is just don&#39;t take other people&#39;s stuff. Not only is it not cool, but on the plus side, you&#39;ll never find yourself in this situation. Or perhaps even worse, this one. - [Man] My girlfriend&#39;s gonna get in here like, who you had in here? (impact) ~ Interactions Reminder (Subscribe, Like, Comment) Removed ~ Back To Top"

"Hello my dudes, my name is Tiffany! Welcome back to my series, Internet Analysis, where I like to research and discuss things relevant to social issues and media. I&#39;ve discussed what happens when YouTubers lose their relatability, and why some popular YouTubers stop uploading. So today, I wanted to continue this discussion. What happens when YouTubers pass their peak? What happens when they&#39;re not relevant anymore? So, in this video I want to discuss the psychological, financial, social, personal, professional impacts of the roller-coaster that is being a YouTuber, especially as your job. First, let&#39;s discuss the psychological impact of fame, and losing it. Many people dream of being famous. Imagine the money, the connections, the opportunities, the adoring fans. When I was a little kid, I wanted to be a pop star, like Britney Spears, then a couple years later, I wanted to be a teacher. then in 2007 I started my first YouTube channel, and I&#39;ve been making videos ever since! By the time monetization came around, my new dream job was to be a YouTuber. And many kids these days want to be YouTubers, or TikTokers, influencers in general. Now, is that a bad or harmful thing for young people? There is SO much to be said about that, that I can&#39;t get into in this video. I think the closest thing we have to compare this to is the experience of being a child star. Especially considering that many content creators become famous at a relatively young age. But these are not the only careers that have this kind of expected expiration date. For child stars, you have a limited time of being considered &#34;cute&#34; and &#34;precocious&#34;, for athletes, you only have your prime, physical body for a number of years, and an injury could end your career at any second. For models and actors, you might age out of the industry by, like, thirty! And then you&#39;re not booked for jobs anymore. Musicians? You might be a one-hit-wonder, you never know. So especially, I think, as YouTubers, you&#39;d have to be kind of delusional to think you will be popular and relevant forever. We are all acutely aware that the clock is ticking, some day the sponsorship offers and opportunities will dry up, your views and likes will dwindle. How long will this last, and what are we gonna do when this career is over? That&#39;s what today&#39;s video is about, baby! And before I jump in, I have an exciting announcement, I am actually finally launching my Patreon! I&#39;ve kind of talked about this, and I&#39;ve been planning it for a long time. If you watched my video about why popular YouTubers stop uploading, I mentioned in there that Patreon can be a really great space to create a smaller, more intimate, tight-knit community. And then I realized: Oh, I want that! So, if you would like to check out my Patreon, there are all of the different tiers and benefits listed there. Whether you would just like to financially support because you like my content -- by the way, thank you so much! if you want any kind of bonus content, I&#39;m gonna be doing some behind the scenes videos, responding to comments, things like that. And I&#39;m also gonna be doing monthly live streams on certain tiers. So again, if you would like to check out my Patreon, please do, the link will be in the description. I am just SO excited to be able to get to know more of you, because, ya know, the comment section can be a busy place. I would like to connect some faces to these usernames. And again, whether or not you would like to, or are able to contribute to the Patreon, I appreciate you so much just for watching this, so... my endless gratitude, thank you for the attention. As we were talking about in this video, I know it&#39;s a limited resource, so I appreciate all of it. So, let&#39;s get back into it! ~ Self Promotions Segment Removed ~ Fame: How does being well-known affect people? Being any kind of famous, or even popular, can make you develop a massive ego. You kind of get this falsely inflated self. Even if you wanted to stay humble, it can be so hard to when you have thousands of people telling you you&#39;re talented and special and different. And after a while, you&#39;ll probably have a constant need for validation, you&#39;ll crave approval and attention. Despite the constant praise, you may even become insecure, you&#39;ll have this nagging worry in the back of your mind, when is this all gonna go away? How can I prolong this fame, my relevance, this income? Eventually, to stay sane, you have to separate your &#39;celebrity self&#39; from your &#39;authentic self&#39;, in order to protect your perception of yourself as a human person, rather than a brand or an image. But even that can make you feel bad, because then you feel fake or two-faced. And of course, for influencers, the line between brand and self is even more blurry because your life is your content and your content IS your life, to whatever extent. Inevitably, you will start to tie your value and your self-worth to your performance. How many followers do you have? How many likes are you getting? Relevance is relative, and it&#39;s also subjective. Someone can be massive in one corner of YouTube and yet completely unknown by other YouTube viewers. (What is Dream? I don&#39;t know! But now millions of their fans may hate me for even asking that.) And in mainstream or traditional spaces it&#39;s even more distinct, because very few YouTubers are household names, and usually the ones that are, are kind of the worst. So anyway, as a creator, your own relevance is based on your audience or community&#39;s perception of you. You might assume that a creator is the most relevant when they hit their highest subscriber count, but they probably FEEL the most relevant when they&#39;re growing the fastest. When a creator is on the rise or blowing up, they might be considered very relevant in their genre at that moment, they&#39;re the hot new thing. The algorithm is in your favor, you&#39;re gaining way more subscribers than usual. Maybe a lot of other creators are starting to watch you and recommend you... Congrats, you&#39;re relevant! For now, at least... Unsustainable Growth. Whether you have a thousand subscribers or ten million, creators have always been able to tell when their channel is doing well, or average, or not so great. But the YouTube Creator Studio really cranked the pressure up to a hundred, with brutal, in-your-face analytics that are practically impossible to escape or ignore. This tool is supposed to help creators see what works for their channel and what doesn&#39;t. It ranks your last ten videos, comparing how many views they&#39;ve gotten in a certain time period, and other metrics like watch time and average view duration. Number one videos get virtual confetti. Honestly, the high rankings can feel so satisfying for a minute, and the low rankings can make you literally want to quit YouTube. The Creator Studio encourages constant growth. Ideally, every video would be ranked 1/10, meaning that each video is performing better than the last, but that&#39;s just not sustainable. If you&#39;re not always improving, you&#39;re doing bad. It&#39;s a flop. By the way, amandamaryanna made a REALLY great video about this, and how focusing on these kind of metrics can really interfere with your creative process, so check out that video if you&#39;re interested. The frustrating thing is, we individually adjust to higher and higher numbers. Like, a few years ago, if my videos were averaging 10,000 views each, that would have been AMAZING. But now, if one of my videos &#34;ONLY&#34; hits 100,000 views, it&#39;s a flop in my mind. It&#39;s so warped. Your channel is DYING. Let&#39;s discuss the downward slope of the roller coaster that is YouTubing. Again, we all know that our popularity won&#39;t last forever, but still, it&#39;s very hard to accept once it starts declining. YouTube channels typically die a slow, painful death, over a number of years. At first, your growth will stagnate, then maybe your views will start dropping, maybe you&#39;re getting less comments, less engagement than usual. But hey, maybe it&#39;s just a bad month. Then you realize you&#39;re no longer gaining subs each month, and actually, every time you upload, you lose subscribers. Now again, because YouTubing is a roller-coaster, it&#39;s normal to have slow periods, or even times of negative growth. Your Social Blade can be in the red, BAD. But we can always turn things around, right? Like, this has happened before, things were slow, and- and then we got that one video picked up by the algorithm, and things were great! Aside from all of that, I think the Creator Studio, and our high expectations for ourselves can really warp our perception of what success is, and not just for creators, but for viewers as well. Let&#39;s say a channel is averaging 100,000 views per video. That&#39;s a successful channel, right? Well, our perception depends... if that channel has 50,000 subscribers, that&#39;s amazing! But what if they have 5 million subscribers? Now that 100,000 views seems low, kind of embarrassing, actually. I think many of us still look at that view to subscriber ratio, even though subscribers really don&#39;t make that big of a difference on YouTube, aside from like, notifications, hit that bell. I&#39;m not good at that call to action. But anyway, a low view to subscriber ratio makes us go oh, dying channel! Now I wanna mention Sarah Hawkinson, who made a really great video recently about what it&#39;s like to &#34;expire&#34; on YouTube, that&#39;s how she put it. She&#39;s been on YouTube for a long time, she&#39;s had her ups and downs with her channel, and her video came out as I was in the middle of writing this one, so it&#39;s like, thank you, very relevant. But also, I&#39;ve always loved Sarah&#39;s videos, I&#39;ve been watching her for years, and I think it&#39;s just a really graceful response to reaching this point where she&#39;s ready to take a step back from YouTube, for the first time in a long time, which is- it&#39;s a big move... &#34;And then, the videos that I wanted to do, the ones that I had fun doing, were not favored by the algorithm, and they were not favored by you, the viewers, and that&#39;s ok. I can&#39;t ignore the fact that people liked my videos more when I talked about controversy and negative things, and I don&#39;t want to do that anymore. Again, I have a beautiful, small community of you that are so supportive, and I love you so much, and I&#39;m so grateful. And I am not trying to focus on the negative, this is the reality, and I have other things that I would love to move on to in my life. And I feel like this is the one thing that I need to sacrifice in order to do that.&#34; Embarrassment, shame, denial. Regardless of how high your peak was, it feels shitty to be past it. If your videos are under-performing, you&#39;re losing subscribers, you may feel like, or be seen as... a flop, a has-been, irrelevant, old news, a dead channel. Yes, this is the negative self-talk that I tell myself if I even have a video that I slightly dislike, so, very healthy mindset. And if you&#39;re doing whatever you can to stay afloat, you may be called a sellout, or desperate. YouTube is a public platform, so it&#39;s not just how you feel about yourself, it&#39;s the awareness that other people can see what you&#39;re doing and how you&#39;re doing. There can be a lot of shame and embarrassment involved, or self-consciousness. And again, if you have tied your self-worth and value personally and professionally to these numbers, once they start declining, how you feel about yourself and your work starts declining, you start devaluing that. It&#39;s not just that your channel is not doing well, you&#39;re not doing well. I can say personally, if I post a video that is not my best, I know that maybe it&#39;s not the best topic, or I could have done something different, I feel like shit. I call myself a flop on a weekly basis, and that&#39;s something that&#39;s really hard to deal with, it sucks to have that negative self-talk, and to not feel confident in your work. I think my thing is, like, I want my subscribers to love every video that I make, and think that it&#39;s thoughtful, or at least thought-provoking in some way, interesting. And so if I think that I have made something below those standards, then I&#39;m just like, Wow, you&#39;re a disaster, a disgrace! So, maybe I should be nicer to myself? Let&#39;s discuss the financial impact. We traditionally imagine that careers should have a steady upward trajectory. You keep working hard, you&#39;re gonna get promoted, you&#39;re gonna get raises, you&#39;re gonna earn more money over your lifetime of your career. Now, of course, it&#39;s become increasingly rare for people to have this situation where you work one job your entire life, work your way up the ladder. It&#39;s a lot more normal these days to change jobs or industries, but I still think we envision the idea that we should earn more money as we get older. For content creators and influencers, you may earn the highest income of your entire life during your teens or your twenties. Which is a double-edged sword, so on one hand, hell yeah, you&#39;re making money, on the other, you&#39;re peaking early. And this is similar to other careers, such as acting, modeling, pro-athletics. If you &#34;peak&#34; in this way so early on, it can feel like the rest of your life will be meaningless, or not as important or significant or impressive, as you were when you were young. And also, so often we see those like, trashy, click-bait articles that are like, &#34;Look at these famous people who went from riches to rags, from billionaire to bankruptcy.&#34; There&#39;s definitely an element of schadenfreude, that sick satisfaction of watching people crash and burn. So anyway, let&#39;s get into the money. If you were ever lucky enough for YouTube to be your full-time living, that&#39;s amazing. Earning money from adsense, sponsorships, affiliate income, things like Patreon. Many of the most popular YouTubers flex their wealth, as we&#39;ve talked about, Flex Culture. They buy cars, and amazing homes... And side note, I am personally invested, how many people are going into debt to pretend like they are rich? Like, faking it until they make it, that worries me. But many creators do have a lavish lifestyle that they can afford, at some point, when you&#39;re making ten, twenty, thirty, a hundred thousand dollars a month. (!!) But then, as your channel becomes less popular, and you&#39;re making less money, how long can you still afford that, can you sustain that? At what point are you now over-spending? When it comes to a dying channel, the immediacy of that financial impact, when you start really feeling it, depends on how high your peak was. Like, were you making $50,000 a year, or millions? Obviously, there&#39;s going to be a big difference in the amount of, like, wiggle room or flexibility you have as your income starts declining. And again, channels die slowly over the course of years, typically, so you do have time to make adjustments to your lifestyle, it&#39;s not too abrupt, usually. But, if you were barely making ends meet before, at your peak, you&#39;re not gonna have that wiggle room when your income starts declining. Something I find really interesting is like, when I hear people calling certain YouTubers, you know, a dying channel, or a flop, a long-time creator can still be incredibly successful, earning a lot of money, still have a solid fanbase, but be considered a flop just because they&#39;re not as successful as they were at their peak. But like, objectively, you could look at them and be like, hey, you&#39;re making six figures? you&#39;re doing well! I often wonder, what happened to that YouTuber I used to watch five or ten years ago? What happened to all the OG YouTubers from like, before the 2010s, or all the lifestyle girlies, what&#39;s up with them? One example I want to share is GloZell, who is an OG YouTuber. I think I actually met her at Vidcon one year. She has recently been opening up about her financial troubles, after being super famous online. For a while, she was making a ton of money, she was very relevant, and she felt like the money would last forever. So, even as her income started to drop, her spending was still very high. Eventually, after 12 rounds of IVF and an expensive divorce, she was in $200,000 of debt. So she&#39;s now warning other content creators, young content creators, to learn how to manage their money before it&#39;s too late. And by the way, I hate to single out GloZell, especially because she was one of the first hugely successful Black women creators on youtube. when I was searching for youtubers who have &#34;gone broke,&#34; it&#39;s pretty much only her who has been speaking out about this experience and being transparent, so first of all I appreciate that so much. We need a lot more transparency because I know this experience is not rare, she&#39;s not the only one who has gone through this. and at least in sharing this, maybe she can help other creators not get in the same situation... or she can help other creators who are in the same boat to not feel as ashamed or embarrassed about going through the same thing. so shouts out GloZell! we are rooting for you. I do worry about all these young YouTubers and people who are getting so much money so easily, and they do expect it to last forever. If you keep your lifestyle manageable and live below your means, yada, yada, yada, you&#39;ll be in a good position. Acting like I&#39;m The Financial Diet or something! When YouTube slows, do you stay or move on? Deciding when to leave YouTube, if at all, is very hard. Do you wait until you have to leave, because you can&#39;t financially support yourself with YouTube alone anymore? Or do you leave when you want to, because there are other things that you&#39;d like to pursue? Of course, it doesn&#39;t have to be all in or out, you can stay on YouTube in a more casual way. But I think, first of all, it&#39;s important to ask, are you even enjoying it anymore? Because yes, once YouTube turns into a job, it&#39;s very easy to like, forget that that&#39;s an option. But that is an important and valid question. Is this something you actually want to be doing, because there are other things in the world. Does this bring you joy and add value to your life, aside from just the income? By the way, there have been tons of great discussions about like, not dreaming of labor on YouTube lately, so many good videos. I think it&#39;s great to NOT glorify our jobs, and expect that our work alone should fulfill us. So, even being a YouTuber does not have to be amazing all the time, it&#39;s not going to be amazing all the time, no work is. But, as with other jobs, especially if you&#39;re in a privileged enough position to have the freedom and flexibility to change jobs, just a reminder that that&#39;s an option. I think sometimes, even despite all the stress and downsides of being a YouTuber, I think that many of us, once we&#39;re in this position, we feel like we&#39;re so lucky and this is such a rare opportunity, that we almost feel like this has to be the pinnacle of success, that nothing in the world could ever be better than this. Or that you could never work another job and be happy, but that&#39;s not true. So, now I wanna specifically talk through these different options of what you can do, whether you decide to stay on YouTube, or if you would like to leave. Stay on YouTube as long as you can. For this section I want to highlight GraveyardGirl, who is kind of now known as the epitome of a dying channel, thanks to Shane Dawson&#39;s series about trying to save her channel. Bunny believes that she peaked in 2014 in video views, and just how she felt about herself and her content. Her peak in subscribers was actually I think in 2018, she got near 9 million subscribers. So, as explored in the ~glorified vlogs~ series, Bunny had gotten very popular, especially for her videos testing out &#39;As Seen On TV&#39; products, does this thing really work? And she kept doing it over and over again, she would get tons and tons of views, and so it became her thing. In this series she was given the advice to kind of expand her channel, change things up, get a little more personal and open with her viewers, to try to promote that growth. And I hadn&#39;t really checked up on her since that series, which came out a few years ago, and she is still doing pretty similar videos. She&#39;s still doing those &#39;does this thing really work&#39; videos, vlogs, car stuff, she&#39;s got her &#39;sippy-sippy&#39;, it&#39;s classic Graveyard Girl. After she was given that second chance, and she, in a lot of people&#39;s eyes, didn&#39;t take the opportunity, she didn&#39;t do what he advised her to do, some people have been kind of frustrated, and calling her boring, like, why doesn&#39;t she change, why is she still doing the same thing she did five, six, seven years ago? And she said, basically, her life and her interests have not changed, so her content hasn&#39;t changed. And it&#39;s funny, because I kind of had that same reaction when I went back to check on her channel, I was like, come ON, Graveyard Girl, why aren&#39;t you changing things up? You&#39;ve gotta, you know, do something if you wanna survive on YouTube. But my friend Katherine helped me question that, when I told her about this. Like, why am I having that reaction? Why is it not just ok for her to continue doing what she wants to do? It&#39;s her choice to be on YouTube, it&#39;s her choice to make whatever content she wants to make. If viewers wanna stay or go, that is also their choice, but that&#39;s the- the name of the game, I guess. On the other hand, if you do want to adapt and evolve, how can you revive a dead channel? How can you pursue a comeback? Typically, the advice that we&#39;re given on YouTube is that you always have to keep changing, because YouTube changes, and the audience changes, and so you&#39;ve gotta change, you&#39;ve gotta adapt, to stay alive. You can&#39;t keep making that same boring, stale content forever. I mean, honestly, you will probably have this loyal group of followers who will watch you no matter what, and actually, you&#39;ll probably have viewers who love that old content. sometimes viewers don&#39;t like seeing creators change, because they like what they used to know you as. But typically, when it comes to the advice on how to grow your channel, that is the recommendation, that is the advice. you&#39;ve gotta change things up, you gotta look at what&#39;s trending, what&#39;s popular, what styles of videos... I found a great example of a creator that has had a pretty awesome comeback, and that is WheezyWaiter. WheezyWaiter is another OG YouTuber, he&#39;s been making videos since 2007, and I watched his videos, starting like, years ago. His peak was between 2010-2012, and he used to make daily videos, very impressive. They were less than 5 minutes long, but they... were very absurd. Like, absolutely nonsensical, I just loved them. But, after years and years, his channel was starting to die, the views were going down. Craig made a video, how he saved his channel. Basically, he adapted, he realized he wanted to start making longer videos, he wanted to work that involved a lot more time and research. So, he couldn&#39;t post daily anymore, but he was gonna focus on quality over quantity. And in the past few years, he&#39;s kind of been specializing in these like, curiosity videos, like, asking questions, why do people like this, or what happens if I do this for a month? He got 11 million views on his &#39;avoiding sugar&#39; video, so that one went viral and definitely helped jumpstart his channel. And with this new series and this new format, his new viewers had a lot of stuff to continue watching. And his content isn&#39;t re-inventing the wheel, it still includes a lot of his classic Craig humor, and a little bit of absurdity. it&#39;s smart, it&#39;s funny, but also, and importantly, the titles and thumbnails are very searchable and they&#39;re usually pretty trendy kind of topics, so that is good for growth. There are plenty of success stories like WheezyWaiter, it is definitely possible to have a comeback, and on YouTube, you know, again, highs and lows, peaks and valleys. It is always possible to start growing again, or at least reach a new audience. Whether you would like to change your content, or maybe some new people will just come see what you&#39;ve been doing all along. Throughout my YouTube history, there was a point, I think my sophomore year in college, where I was close to actually quitting YouTube. But then things changed, and I got new subscribers when I studied abroad in France, and then my channel slowed down again, because I was uninspired. And then, actually, starting Internet Analysis, accidentally became the new revival of my channel, and that has been like, everything, out of my main content, for like, the past three years now. So, you never know if you might stumble upon a new idea that could change everything. Even an old-time YouTuber like me! Next option, you can change your platform or focus. If you would still like to stay on YouTube in some capacity, but maybe not stay on your main channel. As I mentioned in the &#39;Why Popular YouTubers Stop Uploading&#39;, one strategy that&#39;s pretty common lately is for creators to kind of abandon their main channel in favor of their vlog channel. Again, your most loyal viewers who are most dedicated to you are probably gonna be most interested in that kind of personal content. Another trend is to switch to podcasting, or at least supplement your YouTube and Instagram work with podcasting. There are a lot of benefits to podcasting, especially if you have a co-host, it can just be a lot more relaxed, and the format is nice and predictable. For a lot of creators, I think it&#39;s easier to sit down and record a podcast with a friend, than to make main channel content. Then we&#39;ve got things like streaming on Twitch, which has become increasingly popular, everybody&#39;s streaming these days. Finally, when it comes to leaving YouTube or the internet completely... Get a regular JOB? What do you MEAN? Among YouTubers, there can be this kind of fear, or rejection of the idea of getting a &#39;regular job&#39;. It might be that we feel like we&#39;re too special, too creative, too free, to work that 9 to 5 or service job life. And full time YouTubers do get used to a lot of freedom. You work for yourself, you get to dictate your own schedule, your own time off. You&#39;re probably earning a much higher income than you would be at a typical salary job, so... I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve even mentioned this yet, but yeah, being a YouTuber is a very rare and very privileged position, let me always emphasize that. Another aspect of this fear is that for some YouTubers, this literally has been their only job they&#39;ve ever had, this is the only way they&#39;ve ever earned money. Some literally don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to work minimum wage, and that can definitely warp your perception of what work is, and what hard work is. YouTube is work, but it&#39;s a very very different form of work, than minimum wage jobs, service jobs, physical labor, customer service, retail. I wanna give a shout-out to Jonah Green. Jonah is a YouTuber that I&#39;ve known for many years now, and he became like, a famous YouTuber as a teenager. So, he moved to L.A., he lived that classic young YouTuber lifestyle, eventually he pursued acting, he did it all. &#34;Hello, I am Jonah Green and I used to be a full time youtuber. so when I stopped making youtube videos I got a job at a coffee shop. and in the youtube community, especially when I moved to LA... getting a regular job, working a service job, was like the most shameful, embarrassing thing that you could do. and I think that says a lot about the attitudes of people that were in the teenybopper youtube space that I was in at the time. but it also says a lot about the level of privilege that I was living in, because I did not have to work a regular job. I didn&#39;t understand the value of money at the time, I would just like make a video and do a brand deal. And even though I didn&#39;t have a lot of money, I knew that I could always get more... so when the money stopped coming in, I was like OH... this money was valuable and I should have understood how to save it, hahaha.&#34; I&#39;ve watched Jonah&#39;s evolution over the years, and I really appreciated him talking about these things, because I feel like he addressed the anxieties of being a YouTuber, and having this kind of decline, that so many people are ashamed about and don&#39;t want to address. So, I really loved his openness, and I loved hearing about the next things he was always doing, always different projects, or just different regular jobs. I always loved hearing about his philosophies and any wisdom that he got from that. It was cool to just see someone be open about that evolution, those changes. And also, by the way, I feel like we don&#39;t talk enough about how having a regular job can provide so much more stability than being a YouTuber. Like, having structure and a schedule, and like, health insurance. Those are great things! Great perks! You get to clock-in, clock-out, not worry about how your views and likes are on YouTube.com. Also, specifically, many other ex-YouTubers get a job in a related field. Understandably, many content creators wanna use the skills and experience that they&#39;ve cultivated, in a job perhaps in digital media in some form. For example, Caspar Lee has co-founded multiple companies, including an influencer marketing company, and a talent management firm. Some YouTubers end up pursuing other creative things, like music. We have Troye Sivan, the icon! Dodie, Tessa Violet! We also have the option to go back to college, or go to college, if you did not go. Because many influencers, YouTubers, especially if they&#39;re very popular when they&#39;re young, they may choose to hold off and not go to college during their peak popularity, because they wanna take advantage of the opportunities, and maybe when things slow down, it makes sense to go, in the future. Also, by the way, Grace Helbig is currently working on her master&#39;s degree. She hasn&#39;t like, quit YouTube or anything, but I think it&#39;s really cool that she&#39;s going back to school right now. Finally, in conclusion, losing relevance is not the end of the world, and it can actually be a good thing. I wrote this video and wanted to think about this because it&#39;s something that&#39;s on my mind all the time as a YouTuber, tick-tick-tick... Every time I post a video, I&#39;m like hmmm, is this gonna be the flop that ends it all? Again, it&#39;s not a very healthy mindset to be in. It sucks when the downsides of this job can get to you, or just like, being too in your own head, and forgetting that this should be a relatively fun, or freeing, or enjoyable experience, though it is also work. But one interesting thing that I found in researching this video is how often creators talk about, you know, being past their peak. But they talk about how it&#39;s actually made them happier, because they&#39;re not as stressed, there&#39;s not as much concern and pressure about making everything amazing and fantastic. It&#39;s like, they just get to enjoy doing what they want to do. You don&#39;t have to worry as much about algorithms, or what your audience is gonna think, or what if people unsubscribe? Fuck it, if people unsubscribe, that&#39;s fine, they can do that, and you don&#39;t have to worry about it, you don&#39;t have to take it personally. It makes sense that people, including your viewers, will grow, and sometimes people grow apart, and sometimes that means, you know, they&#39;re not gonna watch your content anymore, and that&#39;s ok. To be able to get to the point where you can post, and just vibe! To just be chilling, and not worry about how many views it&#39;s gonna get, or how much money it&#39;s gonna make you, is great. So whether you&#39;re doing YouTube as like, just a part-time gig, for some extra coin, OR if it completely reverts back into a hobby, like it was when you started YouTube. That is just pure fun, there&#39;s no pressure, no strings attached. To get to the point to be like, who cares if I&#39;m relevant? Why should I invest so much energy and emotional weight into something that is inherently fleeting? To end, I just wanna read some Tweets from the iconic Charlie McDonnell, who is an OG YouTuber, he went by the name charlieissocoollike. He stopped making videos a couple years ago, this is part of his thread... &#39;I have essentially quit the YouTube thing, which is weird, because it&#39;s been a part of my life for so long, but it&#39;s also been a very healthy choice for me. It&#39;s helped me to learn that my value as a creator and as a person, can extend beyond being &#39;Charlie Is So Cool Like&#39;. Turns out that tying up your perceived worth in the level of success on a website, is a very bad idea. I found myself much happier creating things that don&#39;t need to have my face on them in order to exist. I find it helps to pick your own metrics for success, rather than blindly following the prescribed ones. For me, that was putting depth of connection over sheer amount of it. I always strive to make what I wanted to make, algorithms be damned!&#39; And I think that&#39;s a good note to end this on. If you are a YouTuber, regardless of size, just remind yourself that you can pick your metrics of value. You can decide how you want to perceive your work, and your worth as a creator. We don&#39;t need to subscribe to this idea that we always have to be chasing for more views, more subscribers, and that if things dip, then somehow you&#39;re worth less? No, that&#39;s not true! The funny thing is, a lot of times a creator&#39;s best work, or what they enjoy the most, or the things that impact the most people the deepest, are not their most viewed videos, they&#39;re not the videos that made the most money. Note to self! Thank you guys so much for watching the WHOLE video, I appreciate it so much! And once again, if you are interested in checking out my Patreon, go see those tiers, go look at those benefits, that means a lot to me. I appreciate all of you. By the way, tonight I do not have any small channel shout-outs, I do have more people on my list for next time, but um, it&#39;s so late, and I just need to stop talking now. Stay tuned for a future Internet Analysis video. &#39;Kay thanks, bye! Back To Top"

"This is a picture of a song. Its fingerprint. Its visual identity. It was generated by a tool that visualizes matching data. And it reveals something really cool about how a song can be structured around lyrical repetition. By the way, this is Vince Staples “Yeah Right”, and it’s been stuck in my head for months. Boy yeah right yeah right yeah right. Boy yeah right yeah right yeah right. This is Colin Morris. He’s a computer programmer that who loves pop music. I did a master&#39;s degree in computational linguistics. Colin created this tool called Song Sim. Each row and each column is a word in a song from beginning to end. But the interesting thing is when you see these structures off the diagonal. Those moments off the diagonal represent some form of repetition. I think my favorite example and one of the earliest ones that I played with was Bad Romance by Lady Gaga. one of the coolest things about this song is just how many different hooks she manages to squeeze into it. Ra ra ah ah ah roma roma ma gaga oh la la want your bad romance. Depending on how you count, there are at least five different lyrical themes that repeat to the point where you start running out of words to describe them. Usually verses aren’t that repetitive. Here, they are. The only part of the song that is falls into a traditional song structure is the bridge. And it really stands out. Still, though, it’s highly repetitive. Walk walk fashion baby work move that bitch crazy. Bad Romance came out in 2009 and since then some of biggest pop songs every year have only gotten more repetitive. We’ll get back to this chart but first, I want to get something out of the way. I really really really really really really like you and I want you do you want me to? Yes that’s true. But not exactly what I want to say. You see, there’s always been a pretty strong sentiment that if a song is structured around excessive repetition it’s uncreative, it&#39;s unchallenging or it lacks complexity. That anti repetition sentiment goes back a laughably long time. All the way back to November 6, 1882 when composer Ferdinand Praeger gave a case against repetition called “On the fallacy of the repetition of parts in the classical form.” Here’s what he said: All will readily admit that a first impression, however striking, is weakened when followed by an immediate repetition. Would ever a poet think of repeating half of his poem; a dramatist a whole act; a novelist a whole chapter ? Such a proposition would be at once rejected as childish. Why should it be otherwise with music? Praeger believed repetition was beneath music when in fact, repetition is decidedly musical. There&#39;s this phenomenon called the speech to song illusion. Have you run across that? That’s Elizabeth Margulis. She directs the Music Cognition Lab at the University of Arkansas and has written a book on musical repetition. There’s this really interesting process where you can take a little bit of speech, you can take a little bit of speech, you can take a little bit of speech. Repeat it a number of times and for many people what initially just sounded like somebody talking to you now sounds like somebody singing. Psychologist Diana Deutsch discovered this illusion in 1995 ironically when she was editing the audio of her CD &#39;Musical Illusions and Paradoxes&#39;. Margulis’ music cognition lab has conducted a number of studies on repetition but there’s one that is really is pretty fascinating. She selected music from renowned 20th century composer, Elliot Carter whose work was is atonal and explicitly non-repetitive. She presented a few versions to a class of 33 students who were unfamiliar with the work. One version was the original, no alterations. The other two versions were digitally altered just to be repetitive without regard for the aesthetic quality of the music. And it turned out that the excerpts that had been kind of adulterated to insert this literal kind of repetition were viewed not only as more enjoyable and more interesting but also was more likely to have been composed by human artists rather than randomly generated by computer. So repetition in music not only feels intentional to our brains we actually enjoy it. Let’s take a look at that chart you saw earlier. It illustrates that our love of repetition was increasingly reflected in pop music. I was surprised by how clear the trend was. Oh yeah, Colin made that too. It turned out that you could basically take any 10 year period over the last 50 years and there would always be an increase in repetition over those 10 years. Yes, pop songs have gotten more repetitive, But repetition can be used to flip predictable song structures to make them completely unpredictable. And that’s really cool. I don&#39;t know if you saw the visualization for &#34;Formation&#34; by Beyonce? Oh yes. Okay ladies now let&#39;s get in formation It&#39;s almost like two songs glued together. With the first half of the song you have this very clear chorus. My daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama Once you get to the second half - that hook disappears and Beyonce replaces it with this catchy hyper repetitive chant. Cause I slay (okay) I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay), I slay (okay) You can&#39;t deny the power of this song. Repetition doesn&#39;t just make it memorable, it reinforces its central message. But when I listen to &#34;Yeah Right&#34; by Vince Staples I&#39;m reminded of the speech to song illusion. When Vince repeats Yeah Right over twenty times,I start to shift my focus from the meaning of the lyric to the rhythm and musicality of it. Boy yeah right yeah right yeah right. Boy yeah right. Repetition grabs a hold of our brains in a way that we often can’t quite control. And that might feel like the music is playing us rather than us playing the music. But if repetition makes songs like Formation, Lose yourself to Dance, Beat It and I wanna dance with Somebody both great and memorable. It can rule the charts forever. Back To Top"

"-The president held his first rally in months on Saturday in an attempt to project political strength as his administration faces a series of crises. Instead, it was a flop, and I should say I get that he wanted to go out and see people. I&#39;ve been in an attic for three months. I miss having guests. Zoom is great. It&#39;s not face to face. But I deal with it because there isn&#39;t a better option. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a magic door behind me that&#39;ll send me a guest if I say their name three times. Ethan Hawke! Ethan Hawke! Ethan Hawke! Right? I mean, that would be stupid, but also, I mean, I mean, how cool would that be? With that said, you know, I haven&#39;t totally hated the &#34;me&#34; time. It&#39;s definitely allowed me to get in touch with myself in a healthy way, and, you know, if a guest was here they&#39;d probably want to go on and on about whatever project they had, and, you know, I don&#39;t -- I don&#39;t need that. Still, I don&#39;t think that would be the case with Ethan Hawke. I mean, the Ethan Hawke. Does go on a bit. Does go on a bit. But he&#39;s Ethan Hawke! He&#39;s one of my all-time favorite actors. Love me some Ethan Hawke. Of course, knowing Ethan, he&#39;d probably have some sort of psychopath man-in-the-woods beard right now and wouldn&#39;t be that camera-ready. Yeah, all things -- all things considered, it&#39;s good not having Ethan Hawke right now. Anyway, I know it was a long time ago, and I probably shouldn&#39;t even say this. I thought in &#34;Dead Poets&#34; when he stood on the desk and said, &#34;O Captain! My Captain!&#34; it was just a little, I don&#39;t know, showoff-y? -It was a character! -Anyway, it&#39;s time for &#34;A Closer Look.&#34; ♪♪ In this moment, protesters across the country are demanding an end to institutional racism and police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic is spiking in more than 20 states, our election infrastructure is falling apart, and millions of Americans are camping out for hours just to file for unemployment amid a historic economic crisis. I mean, look at this. This is insane. Normally, you only see people camped out on the sidewalk like this when there&#39;s a new iPhone or Harry Styles is hosting &#34;SNL,&#34; an episode, by the way, that I couldn&#39;t get tickets to, which is crazy because I had a bit of a run there. This is truly, truly barbaric. If you&#39;re a billion-dollar corporation, you can just call up the government, you get a loan you don&#39;t even need. But if you lose your job thanks to a pandemic the government failed to stop, you have to line up in the heat for hours like you&#39;re waiting for a porta-potty at Ozzfest. And as Ozzy himself would say, our country is ♪ Going off the rails on a crazy train ♪ Yes. Anyway, I just hope it&#39;s not too late to learn how to love and forget how to hate. That was for older brothers born between, what, &#39;63 and &#39;71? The point is we&#39;re in a moment of acute national crisis, thanks in large part to the maligned negligence of this taxidermied business husk. Wow! How&#39;d the sales trip go, Willy Loman? I hope Biff didn&#39;t wander in on you and a strange woman. That would send him in a long tailspin. What happened to you? You look like you just coached the Knicks to a 50-point loss. You should be standing next to Jack Lemmon begging for the Glenn Gary leads. We should never have to see the president in such a pathetic state. It&#39;s embarrassing. The president is supposed to project confidence and strength. Trump, on the other hand, looks like a drunk wedding guest shuffling back to the Marriott. [ As Trump ] Or was it a Hyatt. [ Normal voice ] This is like when you stay up past your bedtime and catch a glimpse of your dad coming home late from work totally plastered. Somehow, this is the perfect imagine to sum up the Trump presidency. Now we just have to change the presidential seal to a drunk eagle snoozing in a BarcaLounger with a beer in one hand and remote control in the other. And I know. I know eagle&#39;s hands are called claws. I made a mistake. But it&#39;s tempting -- Or maybe they&#39;re called talons. Well, I should have looked this up. But as tempting as it may be to think that Trump somehow created all the problems our country is facing, he did not. He certainly made them worse, and in many cases, profited from them. But the structural inequities and institutional failures we&#39;re seeing right now long predated him. They were created in part by guys like Johnny Bolton over here, the ex-National Security Advisor who refused to testify at Trump&#39;s impeachment and is now hawking a book called &#34;Mustache Rides Again.&#34; Oh, wait, I think it&#39;s called &#34;The Trash Behind the Stache.&#34; No, wait, you know what, guys? I think it&#39;s called &#34;Boltin&#39; Bolton&#39;s Butt Ton of Bull Dung.&#34; Anyway, you can find it on Amazon under the &#34;Please Light Your Money on Fire Instead&#34; section. John Bolton is an unrepentant warmonger who has helped usher in some of the worst calamities of the last two decades and who epitomizes our era of venal, self-serving sociopaths burning everything down and then cashing in as they slink away. But other than that, he a great guy. Last night, Bolton was on ABC trying to sell his book about his time in the Trump White House. Trump, a man, let&#39;s not forget, he voted for and then lobbied to get a job with. -I don&#39;t think he&#39;s fit for office. I don&#39;t think he has the competence to carry out the job. -You supported Donald Trump during the 2016 election. You watched his first 15 months in office. What did you think of the job he was doing up to that point? -I think I made a mistake. -No, I don&#39;t think he did. I don&#39;t think he made a mistake. I think you&#39;re a remora, you know those little fish that swim alongside sharks and eat whatever they miss? That&#39;s what all these Trump White House supporting cast members are. And then, when their bellies are full, they swim out of the White House and write a book called, &#34;Damn, That Shark Was Crazy!&#34; &#34;I think a made a mistake&#34; is not how you talk about enthusiastically supporting and working for a racist authoritarian who&#39;s trampling our democracy for his own self-interest. That&#39;s what you say when you get the Domino&#39;s order and realize it has peppers instead of pepperoni. &#34;Oh, damn it. I think I made a mistake. I meant to get pizza, but instead I ordered Domino&#39;s.&#34; Bolton didn&#39;t make a mistake. He saw Trump in 2016 and throughout the first half of his presidency promising to rip up the Iran deal and to kill the families of terrorists and banning of Muslims, and he thought he could use Trump to get what he wanted. It only backfired when he realized Trump&#39;s like a tiger in a circus act. He starts out friendly, but one wrong move, and he will lunge for your face. People like Bolton are a big part of the reason we&#39;re in this mess in the first place, and on top of that, the structural inequities in our sham democracy ensure that a party with a disastrous 20-year record of governance over the course of two historically awful presidents can keep winning elections. They don&#39;t need to be popular if voter suppression and an antiquated electoral college system can keep them in power. And sure enough, the Trump team is already sending signals that they plan to interfere with the actual administration of the election. This weekend, for example, the Attorney General Bill Barr repeated a series of obvious lies about mail-in voting, which many state officials, including Republicans, have turned to as a safe alternative during the pandemic. Barr claimed falsely that mail-in ballots somehow open the floodgates to fraud. -Well, there&#39;s a big discussion right now about mail-in voting. Hillary Clinton said it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fair. -Well, it absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud. Those things are delivered into mailboxes. They can be taken out. There&#39;s questions about whether or not it even denies a secret ballot because a lot of the states have you signing the outside of the envelope, so the person who opens the envelope will know how people voted. There&#39;s no -- Right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and it&#39;d be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot. So I think it can -- it can upset and undercut the confidence in the integrity of our elections. -You know what upsets confidence in the integrity of our elections? People having to stand in line to vote like they&#39;re waiting to take pictures with the mall Santa on December 23rd. Of course, if Bill Barr was in charge, they&#39;d have to line up on August 8th. Second, none of what you said is true. You can&#39;t just print up fake mail ballots and send them in. You know they still check to make sure they&#39;re from registered voters, right? It&#39;s not like you could just write on a piece of paper &#34;I vote for Joe Exotic&#34; and send it to the Board of Elections, although honestly, at this rate, I&#39;m desperate enough to try it. Hey! I think he&#39;s learned his lesson. I saw some real growth from Joe. And then this morning, Trump himself tweeted... They&#39;re trying to cheat by disrupting the actual administration of the election, and that&#39;s because they&#39;re so worried that if voters get to vote fairly, he won&#39;t win. Donald Trump is now and has always been a historically unpopular president. He&#39;s just been able to mask his unpopularity and soothe his ego with large crowds at his mosh pit/group therapy sessions, which is why his rally in Tulsa on Saturday, his first in months, was planned as a big show of political strength, nevermind the fact that Tulsa is a coronavirus hotspot with spiking numbers that have alarmed local health officials. Trump disregarded that just to make himself feel better. Beforehand, Trump base told CNN that the rally wasn&#39;t just about politics. It was... You know what else is good for that? Prozac. You just slip some into his hamburger, you know, the way you give pills to a dog. Or slap a label on the bottle that says, &#34;Hydroxychloroquine.&#34; [ As Trump ] This stuff cures neverything. [ Normal voice ] Think about that -- The president held an indoor rally at a coronavirus hotspot, putting people&#39;s lives at risk just to make himself feel better. Can&#39;t we just get that truck back to the White House lawn and let him honk the horn a few times? &#34;Do you feel better, Mr. President?&#34; [ As Trump ] I am feeling a little bit better. [ Normal voice ] At this rate, he should be doing his rallies on a fainting couch while a doctor takes notes. Still, there you go -- The president&#39;s aides said Saturday&#39;s rally would put him in a much better mood, and clearly, Trump was looking forward to it because he spent all week bragging about the number of people who had RSVP&#39;d. -They have a new, a pretty new, magnificent arena, as you probably have heard. And we&#39;re getting exact numbers out, but we&#39;re either close to or over one million people wanting to go. We have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we&#39;re gonna also take the convention hall next door, and that&#39;s gonna hold 40,000. So we&#39;ll have 22,000, plus 40,000, which would mean that we&#39;d have over 900,000 people that won&#39;t be able to go, but hopefully they&#39;ll be watching. But it&#39;s an amazing -- Nobody&#39;s ever heard of numbers like this. -You got to love how Trump thinks a success is a situation in which 90% of his supporters get screwed. [ As Trump ] Also, we have a baked potato bar, all the fixings for everyone who doesn&#39;t get in. Just the two potatoes, though, so show up early. [ Normal voice ] Nobody&#39;s ever heard numbers like this? You know what number of people have heard? 6,200, the actual number of people who showed up, according to the fire marshall, and that fire marshall was probably the only person in Tulsa who had a good night. He was like, &#34;Oh, this is great. If there&#39;s a fire, we&#39;ll get everybody out of here in, like, 30 seconds.&#34; Trump&#39;s team kept ramping up expectations. His campaign manager Brad Parscale bragged that a million people -- a million people had RSVP&#39;d and that they&#39;d have a total of close to 100,000. You guys sure you want to call your shot like that? You&#39;re like a basketball player giving a pre-game press conference about how many points he scored. &#34;You know, I just want to thank God and my teammates for supporting me. It wasn&#39;t easy to score a 50 in a game, but I did it. All right. I&#39;m gonna go warm up. Achilles is pretty tight.&#34; Although my favorite, favorite Trump prediction has to be this one. -And we expect to have -- you know, it&#39;s like a record-setting crowd. We&#39;ve never had an empty seat. And we certainly won&#39;t in Oklahoma. -We certainly won&#39;t have an empty seat in Oklahoma. It&#39;s too perfect. This is like if Babe Ruth had pointed to center field and then stepped into the box and fouled one off his ankle. &#34;Oh [bleep]! Oh, no, I think I broke it! Oh [bleep]! Can you edit out the part where I pointed? We&#39;re live?! Oh [bleep]!&#34; So the president banked not only his political comeback but his mood in a big show of force in Tulsa. And then, you know, this happened. -President Trump&#39;s first campaign rally in more than 100 days drew controversy and a smaller-than-expected crowd. The upper decks of the arena there in Tulsa, Oklahoma, were largely empty. -There were plenty of empty seats in the 19,000-capacity BOK Center. -But in the end, the president was a bit of a bust in Tulsa. Campaign quickly dismantling one venue. That other venue, about one-third full. Tulsa&#39;s fire department saying about 6,200 people showed up in an arena that held 19,000 for the president. Wow, I&#39;ve seen less empty seats at an improv show. And, let&#39;s be honest, Trump&#39;s rallies are basically an improv show where he gives himself his own suggestion. [ As Trump ] Can I have the name of a famous person? I heard Hillary. [ Normal voice ] The arena wasn&#39;t even one-third full. Trump staked his political fortunes and his ego on this rally, and it was such a flop, they even had to cancel a planned second speech to what they thought would be an overflow crowd outside. Before Trump had landed, crews were literally breaking down the stage because so few people were there. Wow! He&#39;s the President of the United States, and they&#39;re treating him like the least popular band at Coachella. &#34;Sorry, bro, I guess everybody went over to see Beyoncé. You can keep the lanyards if you want. What kind of music do you guys do anyway? Rage rap?&#34; And Trump&#39;s performance was just as lackluster as the attendance. You&#39;d think at a moment like this, the president might want to offer soothing words about the state of the nation and the various crises we face. Instead, Trump spent one of every eight minutes in Tulsa complaining about coverage of his West Point speech. Specifically, he complained about the coverage of the way he tiptoed down a ramp like a toddler on ice skates, and the way he drank water. -So then my wife said, &#34;Well, it wasn&#39;t only the ramp. Did you have water?&#34; So what happens is I said, &#34;What does it have to do with water?&#34; They said, &#34;You couldn&#39;t lift your hand up to your mouth with water.&#34; She said, &#34;Well, I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie.&#34; And I don&#39;t want to get water on the tie. And I don&#39;t want to drink much. So I lifted up the water. I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? [ Cheers and applause ] So I put it up to my lip, and then I say, because I don&#39;t want it -- Just in case. And they gave me another disease. [ Laughter ] They gave me another disease. [ Laughter ] [ Cheers and applause ] -Seriously, has a president&#39;s base ever set a lower bar? &#34;Whoo! That arm works! That arm works!&#34; The crowd cheered the president drinking water with one hand the way NASA cheered when they landed a rover on Mars. That&#39;s not supposed to be impressive. &#34;Good news, he&#39;s drinking water with one hand&#34; is something a doctor would say to you about a loved one who was recently hit on the head by a falling can of paint. &#34;He&#39;s regained motor function in his right arm. Unfortunately, he is, um... he is still having trouble with the ramp.&#34; Although the biggest lie in that story might be the idea that he had a conversation with his wife. And even if he did, what a horrible conversation. Her first question to you was, &#34;Did you have water?&#34; That&#39;s not a question you ask a president or a loved one. That&#39;s a question you ask a sick cat. The president staked his political fortunes on a rally that turned out to be a dud amid a series of mounting crises that have deflated his already historically bad poll numbers. It&#39;s a reminder that this president is deeply unpopular. And his only hope of getting re-elected is by scaring people and undermining the integrity of the election itself. And when he and his campaign look back on their decision to brag so much about this rally in advance, I bet they&#39;ll say to themselves... -I think I made a mistake.

explanation
"The video uses the word "bleep" to censor what would otherwise be considered profane language. While this is a common practice, it does technically include a reference to profanity. The use is infrequent and within the context of a comedic, satirical commentary, minimizing the impact on advertiser-friendliness. However, repeated or more explicit use could result in demonetization."

"-The president held his first rally in months on Saturday in an attempt to project political strength as his administration faces a series of crises. Instead, it was a flop, and I should say I get that he wanted to go out and see people. I&#39;ve been in an attic for three months. I miss having guests. Zoom is great. It&#39;s not face to face. But I deal with it because there isn&#39;t a better option. It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a magic door behind me that&#39;ll send me a guest if I say their name three times. Ethan Hawke! Ethan Hawke! Ethan Hawke! Right? I mean, that would be stupid, but also, I mean, I mean, how cool would that be? With that said, you know, I haven&#39;t totally hated the &#34;me&#34; time. It&#39;s definitely allowed me to get in touch with myself in a healthy way, and, you know, if a guest was here they&#39;d probably want to go on and on about whatever project they had, and, you know, I don&#39;t -- I don&#39;t need that. Still, I don&#39;t think that would be the case with Ethan Hawke. I mean, the Ethan Hawke. Does go on a bit. Does go on a bit. But he&#39;s Ethan Hawke! He&#39;s one of my all-time favorite actors. Love me some Ethan Hawke. Of course, knowing Ethan, he&#39;d probably have some sort of psychopath man-in-the-woods beard right now and wouldn&#39;t be that camera-ready. Yeah, all things -- all things considered, it&#39;s good not having Ethan Hawke right now. Anyway, I know it was a long time ago, and I probably shouldn&#39;t even say this. I thought in &#34;Dead Poets&#34; when he stood on the desk and said, &#34;O Captain! My Captain!&#34; it was just a little, I don&#39;t know, showoff-y? -It was a character! -Anyway, it&#39;s time for &#34;A Closer Look.&#34; ♪♪ In this moment, protesters across the country are demanding an end to institutional racism and police brutality, the coronavirus pandemic is spiking in more than 20 states, our election infrastructure is falling apart, and millions of Americans are camping out for hours just to file for unemployment amid a historic economic crisis. I mean, look at this. This is insane. Normally, you only see people camped out on the sidewalk like this when there&#39;s a new iPhone or Harry Styles is hosting &#34;SNL,&#34; an episode, by the way, that I couldn&#39;t get tickets to, which is crazy because I had a bit of a run there. This is truly, truly barbaric. If you&#39;re a billion-dollar corporation, you can just call up the government, you get a loan you don&#39;t even need. But if you lose your job thanks to a pandemic the government failed to stop, you have to line up in the heat for hours like you&#39;re waiting for a porta-potty at Ozzfest. And as Ozzy himself would say, our country is ♪ Going off the rails on a crazy train ♪ Yes. Anyway, I just hope it&#39;s not too late to learn how to love and forget how to hate. That was for older brothers born between, what, &#39;63 and &#39;71? The point is we&#39;re in a moment of acute national crisis, thanks in large part to the maligned negligence of this taxidermied business husk. Wow! How&#39;d the sales trip go, Willy Loman? I hope Biff didn&#39;t wander in on you and a strange woman. That would send him in a long tailspin. What happened to you? You look like you just coached the Knicks to a 50-point loss. You should be standing next to Jack Lemmon begging for the Glenn Gary leads. We should never have to see the president in such a pathetic state. It&#39;s embarrassing. The president is supposed to project confidence and strength. Trump, on the other hand, looks like a drunk wedding guest shuffling back to the Marriott. [ As Trump ] Or was it a Hyatt. [ Normal voice ] This is like when you stay up past your bedtime and catch a glimpse of your dad coming home late from work totally plastered. Somehow, this is the perfect imagine to sum up the Trump presidency. Now we just have to change the presidential seal to a drunk eagle snoozing in a BarcaLounger with a beer in one hand and remote control in the other. And I know. I know eagle&#39;s hands are called claws. I made a mistake. But it&#39;s tempting -- Or maybe they&#39;re called talons. Well, I should have looked this up. But as tempting as it may be to think that Trump somehow created all the problems our country is facing, he did not. He certainly made them worse, and in many cases, profited from them. But the structural inequities and institutional failures we&#39;re seeing right now long predated him. They were created in part by guys like Johnny Bolton over here, the ex-National Security Advisor who refused to testify at Trump&#39;s impeachment and is now hawking a book called &#34;Mustache Rides Again.&#34; Oh, wait, I think it&#39;s called &#34;The Trash Behind the Stache.&#34; No, wait, you know what, guys? I think it&#39;s called &#34;Boltin&#39; Bolton&#39;s Butt Ton of Bull Dung.&#34; Anyway, you can find it on Amazon under the &#34;Please Light Your Money on Fire Instead&#34; section. John Bolton is an unrepentant warmonger who has helped usher in some of the worst calamities of the last two decades and who epitomizes our era of venal, self-serving sociopaths burning everything down and then cashing in as they slink away. But other than that, he a great guy. Last night, Bolton was on ABC trying to sell his book about his time in the Trump White House. Trump, a man, let&#39;s not forget, he voted for and then lobbied to get a job with. -I don&#39;t think he&#39;s fit for office. I don&#39;t think he has the competence to carry out the job. -You supported Donald Trump during the 2016 election. You watched his first 15 months in office. What did you think of the job he was doing up to that point? -I think I made a mistake. -No, I don&#39;t think he did. I don&#39;t think he made a mistake. I think you&#39;re a remora, you know those little fish that swim alongside sharks and eat whatever they miss? That&#39;s what all these Trump White House supporting cast members are. And then, when their bellies are full, they swim out of the White House and write a book called, &#34;Damn, That Shark Was Crazy!&#34; &#34;I think a made a mistake&#34; is not how you talk about enthusiastically supporting and working for a racist authoritarian who&#39;s trampling our democracy for his own self-interest. That&#39;s what you say when you get the Domino&#39;s order and realize it has peppers instead of pepperoni. &#34;Oh, damn it. I think I made a mistake. I meant to get pizza, but instead I ordered Domino&#39;s.&#34; Bolton didn&#39;t make a mistake. He saw Trump in 2016 and throughout the first half of his presidency promising to rip up the Iran deal and to kill the families of terrorists and banning of Muslims, and he thought he could use Trump to get what he wanted. It only backfired when he realized Trump&#39;s like a tiger in a circus act. He starts out friendly, but one wrong move, and he will lunge for your face. People like Bolton are a big part of the reason we&#39;re in this mess in the first place, and on top of that, the structural inequities in our sham democracy ensure that a party with a disastrous 20-year record of governance over the course of two historically awful presidents can keep winning elections. They don&#39;t need to be popular if voter suppression and an antiquated electoral college system can keep them in power. And sure enough, the Trump team is already sending signals that they plan to interfere with the actual administration of the election. This weekend, for example, the Attorney General Bill Barr repeated a series of obvious lies about mail-in voting, which many state officials, including Republicans, have turned to as a safe alternative during the pandemic. Barr claimed falsely that mail-in ballots somehow open the floodgates to fraud. -Well, there&#39;s a big discussion right now about mail-in voting. Hillary Clinton said it&#39;s fine, it&#39;s fair. -Well, it absolutely opens the floodgates to fraud. Those things are delivered into mailboxes. They can be taken out. There&#39;s questions about whether or not it even denies a secret ballot because a lot of the states have you signing the outside of the envelope, so the person who opens the envelope will know how people voted. There&#39;s no -- Right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots and it&#39;d be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot. So I think it can -- it can upset and undercut the confidence in the integrity of our elections. -You know what upsets confidence in the integrity of our elections? People having to stand in line to vote like they&#39;re waiting to take pictures with the mall Santa on December 23rd. Of course, if Bill Barr was in charge, they&#39;d have to line up on August 8th. Second, none of what you said is true. You can&#39;t just print up fake mail ballots and send them in. You know they still check to make sure they&#39;re from registered voters, right? It&#39;s not like you could just write on a piece of paper &#34;I vote for Joe Exotic&#34; and send it to the Board of Elections, although honestly, at this rate, I&#39;m desperate enough to try it. Hey! I think he&#39;s learned his lesson. I saw some real growth from Joe. And then this morning, Trump himself tweeted... They&#39;re trying to cheat by disrupting the actual administration of the election, and that&#39;s because they&#39;re so worried that if voters get to vote fairly, he won&#39;t win. Donald Trump is now and has always been a historically unpopular president. He&#39;s just been able to mask his unpopularity and soothe his ego with large crowds at his mosh pit/group therapy sessions, which is why his rally in Tulsa on Saturday, his first in months, was planned as a big show of political strength, nevermind the fact that Tulsa is a coronavirus hotspot with spiking numbers that have alarmed local health officials. Trump disregarded that just to make himself feel better. Beforehand, Trump base told CNN that the rally wasn&#39;t just about politics. It was... You know what else is good for that? Prozac. You just slip some into his hamburger, you know, the way you give pills to a dog. Or slap a label on the bottle that says, &#34;Hydroxychloroquine.&#34; [ As Trump ] This stuff cures neverything. [ Normal voice ] Think about that -- The president held an indoor rally at a coronavirus hotspot, putting people&#39;s lives at risk just to make himself feel better. Can&#39;t we just get that truck back to the White House lawn and let him honk the horn a few times? &#34;Do you feel better, Mr. President?&#34; [ As Trump ] I am feeling a little bit better. [ Normal voice ] At this rate, he should be doing his rallies on a fainting couch while a doctor takes notes. Still, there you go -- The president&#39;s aides said Saturday&#39;s rally would put him in a much better mood, and clearly, Trump was looking forward to it because he spent all week bragging about the number of people who had RSVP&#39;d. -They have a new, a pretty new, magnificent arena, as you probably have heard. And we&#39;re getting exact numbers out, but we&#39;re either close to or over one million people wanting to go. We have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we&#39;re gonna also take the convention hall next door, and that&#39;s gonna hold 40,000. So we&#39;ll have 22,000, plus 40,000, which would mean that we&#39;d have over 900,000 people that won&#39;t be able to go, but hopefully they&#39;ll be watching. But it&#39;s an amazing -- Nobody&#39;s ever heard of numbers like this. -You got to love how Trump thinks a success is a situation in which 90% of his supporters get screwed. [ As Trump ] Also, we have a baked potato bar, all the fixings for everyone who doesn&#39;t get in. Just the two potatoes, though, so show up early. [ Normal voice ] Nobody&#39;s ever heard numbers like this? You know what number of people have heard? 6,200, the actual number of people who showed up, according to the fire marshall, and that fire marshall was probably the only person in Tulsa who had a good night. He was like, &#34;Oh, this is great. If there&#39;s a fire, we&#39;ll get everybody out of here in, like, 30 seconds.&#34; Trump&#39;s team kept ramping up expectations. His campaign manager Brad Parscale bragged that a million people -- a million people had RSVP&#39;d and that they&#39;d have a total of close to 100,000. You guys sure you want to call your shot like that? You&#39;re like a basketball player giving a pre-game press conference about how many points he scored. &#34;You know, I just want to thank God and my teammates for supporting me. It wasn&#39;t easy to score a 50 in a game, but I did it. All right. I&#39;m gonna go warm up. Achilles is pretty tight.&#34; Although my favorite, favorite Trump prediction has to be this one. -And we expect to have -- you know, it&#39;s like a record-setting crowd. We&#39;ve never had an empty seat. And we certainly won&#39;t in Oklahoma. -We certainly won&#39;t have an empty seat in Oklahoma. It&#39;s too perfect. This is like if Babe Ruth had pointed to center field and then stepped into the box and fouled one off his ankle. &#34;Oh [bleep]! Oh, no, I think I broke it! Oh [bleep]! Can you edit out the part where I pointed? We&#39;re live?! Oh [bleep]!&#34; So the president banked not only his political comeback but his mood in a big show of force in Tulsa. And then, you know, this happened. -President Trump&#39;s first campaign rally in more than 100 days drew controversy and a smaller-than-expected crowd. The upper decks of the arena there in Tulsa, Oklahoma, were largely empty. -There were plenty of empty seats in the 19,000-capacity BOK Center. -But in the end, the president was a bit of a bust in Tulsa. Campaign quickly dismantling one venue. That other venue, about one-third full. Tulsa&#39;s fire department saying about 6,200 people showed up in an arena that held 19,000 for the president. Wow, I&#39;ve seen less empty seats at an improv show. And, let&#39;s be honest, Trump&#39;s rallies are basically an improv show where he gives himself his own suggestion. [ As Trump ] Can I have the name of a famous person? I heard Hillary. [ Normal voice ] The arena wasn&#39;t even one-third full. Trump staked his political fortunes and his ego on this rally, and it was such a flop, they even had to cancel a planned second speech to what they thought would be an overflow crowd outside. Before Trump had landed, crews were literally breaking down the stage because so few people were there. Wow! He&#39;s the President of the United States, and they&#39;re treating him like the least popular band at Coachella. &#34;Sorry, bro, I guess everybody went over to see Beyoncé. You can keep the lanyards if you want. What kind of music do you guys do anyway? Rage rap?&#34; And Trump&#39;s performance was just as lackluster as the attendance. You&#39;d think at a moment like this, the president might want to offer soothing words about the state of the nation and the various crises we face. Instead, Trump spent one of every eight minutes in Tulsa complaining about coverage of his West Point speech. Specifically, he complained about the coverage of the way he tiptoed down a ramp like a toddler on ice skates, and the way he drank water. -So then my wife said, &#34;Well, it wasn&#39;t only the ramp. Did you have water?&#34; So what happens is I said, &#34;What does it have to do with water?&#34; They said, &#34;You couldn&#39;t lift your hand up to your mouth with water.&#34; She said, &#34;Well, I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie.&#34; And I don&#39;t want to get water on the tie. And I don&#39;t want to drink much. So I lifted up the water. I see we have a little glass of water. Where the hell did this water come from? [ Cheers and applause ] So I put it up to my lip, and then I say, because I don&#39;t want it -- Just in case. And they gave me another disease. [ Laughter ] They gave me another disease. [ Laughter ] [ Cheers and applause ] -Seriously, has a president&#39;s base ever set a lower bar? &#34;Whoo! That arm works! That arm works!&#34; The crowd cheered the president drinking water with one hand the way NASA cheered when they landed a rover on Mars. That&#39;s not supposed to be impressive. &#34;Good news, he&#39;s drinking water with one hand&#34; is something a doctor would say to you about a loved one who was recently hit on the head by a falling can of paint. &#34;He&#39;s regained motor function in his right arm. Unfortunately, he is, um... he is still having trouble with the ramp.&#34; Although the biggest lie in that story might be the idea that he had a conversation with his wife. And even if he did, what a horrible conversation. Her first question to you was, &#34;Did you have water?&#34; That&#39;s not a question you ask a president or a loved one. That&#39;s a question you ask a sick cat. The president staked his political fortunes on a rally that turned out to be a dud amid a series of mounting crises that have deflated his already historically bad poll numbers. It&#39;s a reminder that this president is deeply unpopular. And his only hope of getting re-elected is by scaring people and undermining the integrity of the election itself. And when he and his campaign look back on their decision to brag so much about this rally in advance, I bet they&#39;ll say to themselves... -I think I made a mistake. This has been &#34;A Closer Look.&#34; ♪♪ As New York works hard to reopen under phase two, remember that we&#39;re still a city in crisis. And City Harvest has been stepping up to meet the increased need. If you&#39;re watching this online, you can hit the &#34;donate&#34; button.

"Hate speech (potential): While not explicitly hateful, the highly critical and insulting language towards President Trump and John Bolton could be interpreted as bordering on hate speech by some viewers.
