"all right what&#39;s going on guys it&#39;s Chad so we just got some confirmation from Activision themselves and it&#39;s a bit of an update and a shakeup of uh what we know Black Ops 7 to be i was planning on uploading a different video today but then all this stuff dropped at like 4 in the afternoon or whatever so all of the information that we&#39;ve had about Black Ops 7 mostly came from like the idea that we knew that Treyarch was somehow making another uh Black Ops game to follow up kind of like MW2 to MW3 recently we have two games in the same verse back toback we were thinking of a bunch of different names and everything and with the more futuristic setting some people were thinking we could potentially get like jetpacks and other stuff like that now I get some information from people that isn&#39;t public sometimes but like I haven&#39;t heard anything about a jetpack or anything close to the jetpack gods we&#39;ve had nothing close to Advanced Warfare not even Black Ops 3 not Infinite Warfare we had an idea of what the game was going to be it was going to be futuristic but not so futuristic to where it&#39;s got jetpacks and stuff like that and there was supposed to be some different Omni movement initially we were thinking that there was going to be some sort of wall running mechanic black Ops 3 you can wall run so we we&#39;ve already had this in the game before and there was also some gameplay that went around that at this point I&#39;m not entirely sure if it was faked or not or what or maybe it was like a feature that no one&#39;s using kind of future for an LTM but anyway Charlie Intel tweets Activision says that Call of Duty Black Ops 7 will not have wall running or jetpacks the game&#39;s movement will be a quote evolution of omni movement the game is set 30 years before Black Ops 3 so there are no jetpacks to me the timeline didn&#39;t really matter overall because it&#39;s Call of Duty and no one really actually cares about the timeline itself and it doesn&#39;t necessarily need to make sense chronologically they&#39;ve already recconed a million things characters that are supposedly dead we watched them literally die are back alive nukes have gone up and then the map has come back it doesn&#39;t actually make any sense or matter but whatever that&#39;s what Activision says we&#39;re not going to get wall running or jetpacks i was thinking that the wall running was all but confirmed as soon as I saw that leaked gameplay of somebody wall running in War Zone I was thinking it was a feature that they were using some kind of tool to utilize and maybe it was just something that wasn&#39;t used but now I can&#39;t tell that did they somehow fake it i I don&#39;t even know how they could have faked it it looked pretty natural to me carly Intel also follows was a leak from October 2024 on Black Ops 7 not all of it is confirmed but has an evolution of omniovement which is now confirmed has a wall jump so I guess this is like some kind of like little wall hop where maybe if like a wall is really tall in front of you you can run and jump onto the wall and kind of do like a parkour like little second hop up almost like uh Elder Ring Night Reign where they added that extra little hop on the walls that you can get also it could be kind of like a redirection thing where like you could be running towards a wall or like running at the wall at an angle and then kind of like to throw people off you could jump at the wall and then kind of jump off in a different direction or they could go even crazier and do like a sakiro or ninja guided where you got two walls really close next to each other and you can jump towards the wall jump back off of it hit the other wall jump off of that one back and forth back and forth to climb up i&#39;m going to be honest with you man if they add this wall jumping mechanic I&#39;m kind of hoping that it&#39;s more of a useless gimmick than it is an actually like gamedefining map defining kind of feature because if they are going to make all of the maps with this wall hop in mind which again is not confirmed they didn&#39;t say that but a part of that leak that does have a confirmed thing in it now with the omniirectional stuff although that&#39;s a pretty easy thing to predict in my opinion an evolution of omniovement is not necessarily a really spot-on thing i think a lot of people could have like thrown that out there there would be some kind of new movement thing if we are following that and that wall jump is there and it&#39;s something where you can like jump back and forth off of the walls and other stuff like that i mean the maps are going to end up having a ton of verticality now walls will be taller walls will probably be closer to each other tighter hallways more verticality in smaller tighter places me personally I&#39;m not a fan of like a lot of vertical maps it gets kind of annoying and it&#39;s just a bunch of people fighting for like the highest uh point on the map a lot of the time and it becomes pretty boring and annoying very quickly to be fair that&#39;s all Call of Duty ever really does pretty quickly anyway so another thing is body shield update no idea what that means uplink returns which is a pretty cool game mode i remember watching it on the competitive scene on Black Ops 3 there were some really cool moments some people like slam dunking doing crazy movement surviving wall run jump over toss the ball for a [ __ ] three-pointer uplink is a cool mode uh Face Off and Gunfight Returns that makes a lot of sense faceoff was very very popular especially at the start of Black Ops 6 just more kills more quickly more progress on camos and stuff like that now with that said they have adjusted it you do get less XP overall for playing the mode at that time if you&#39;re going for camos it&#39;s less about the XP and more about the camos themselves and thenorked perks feature so maybe some perks like have more bonuses if they&#39;re linked together kind of thing kind of similar to where if you picked like three of the same color perks on Black Ops 6 you would get some kind of bonus but maybe it&#39;s like two different ones where a perk will have like two or maybe even three bonuses to each of them but you only unlock the next passive of that perk if you have another perk that coincides with it somehow either by color or just a certain combination a red and green unlocks this passive a blue and green unlocks this passive i&#39;m just theory crafting none of that is confirmed or anything like that obviously but they do say and quote &#34;The game&#39;s movement will be an evolution of omni movement.&#34; Scope ended up replying to people they were like &#34;Yeah man you guys really want jetpacks until the SPMM kicks in.&#34; And he ain&#39;t lying b3 got pretty sweaty i can&#39;t imagine what would happen now to be fair I mean they could just add like a a casual multiplayer mode and people will just farm bots the entire time I guess and maybe they&#39;ll completely invalidate the entire camo grind as well imagine you could just do the camo grind with bots i mean you could already kind of do that in some instances but I mean the entire multiplayer camo grind it could be completely made casual the thing is like I feel like the camos are a part of like they are very aware that the camo system keeps people playing longer otherwise they wouldn&#39;t have invested so much over the years they have improved the system more and more every single year and they do know that it definitely increases the amount of time that people play i mean once I&#39;m done with the camos and stuff like that my play time usually goes down unless there&#39;s something like I&#39;m working towards or the updates are like really good at the time or whatever it really depends overall but still the camo grind is like the first couple weeks of that is like a massive amount of play time put in there and this is me like going at it hardcore there are people that go even harder than I do but casual player can take they can spend the entire year doing all the camos i think that&#39;s probably the next step though i&#39;m going to be honest with you with the addition of all the AI uh modes and stuff like that the casual modes I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there would be like a casual multiplayer mode that actually counts towards your camos and stuff as well and gives like the same amount of XP or some crazy [ __ ] like that i don&#39;t know i feel like it&#39;s only going to get worse to be honest with you i know this video sounds pretty pessimistic overall but again I&#39;m excited to play a Call of Duty every single year i enjoy doing the whole camo grinds now given I did not enjoy and I took my sweet time doing the war zone grind and it was worth it but I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to do that again now I wonder if they&#39;re going to add a new mastery camo to War Zone with that update then i feel like they should and they probably will again this is all speculation the majority of all of this is speculation rumors and leaks things are subject to change i know that sounds like a copout but there are things that I have seen with my eyeballs that just never made it to the game before so things do change things do change things were planned things were worked on but they just don&#39;t make the cut for one reason or another sometimes am I spectating a bot here by the way i I haven&#39;t read my comments or anything about it is it possible to spectate bots i I don&#39;t feel like it should be but I feel like I am right now i mean he&#39;s level one i don&#39;t know anyway let me know what you guys think about Black Ops 7 can&#39;t imagine the game will be that different but especially now confirming like no jetpacks or anything like that i didn&#39;t think the jetpacks would be that likely but watching the trailer as well didn&#39;t see any exo suit or anything like that no flying around we did see some cloaking and whatever but if that wall jump is a thing it could be good it could be not so good we&#39;ll see i guess the general replies to this I mean it&#39;s got a lot of traction almost a million views over here give us jetpacks man unacceptable this is Scopes thing I was mentioning you think you want jetpacks until SPMM hits all Call of Duty does is disappoint me wonderful news for you Charlie we know you can&#39;t keep up as an old man I&#39;m happy about this i kind of wanted wall running it seems like these rumors that have been going around about like what kind of movement and different things we&#39;re going to end up having have kind of split people a good amount some people seem happy about it others not so much hoping for something fun for once what a disappoint it&#39;s actually crazy overall too because years ago whenever we had a jetack Call of Duty people were furious the most disliked trailer in Call of Duty history was because it was jetpacks not even because it was a bad game next to the microtransactions at the time hoping for something fun for what i&#39;m telling you right now all of these same people will absolutely be crying as soon as they get in there going to hit anyway give me something new to learn it&#39;s Call of Duty you don&#39;t ever learn anything new spmm is there anyway so at least make the game fun and refreshing i think that&#39;s cool i do want jetpacks well we&#39;re facing sweats regardless may as well shake things up everybody&#39;s just saying that like jetpacks is more engaging gameplay and I agree it is i think Advanced Warfare had the highest skill gap out of all of them a lot of people refer back to Black Ops 3 i always refer back to Advanced Warfare if you guys really want some kind of movement skill gap go with that but again more movement is going to scare casual players away we can have as many people as possible underneath of this tweet saying &#34;I want a challenge i want this i want that.&#34; The truth is the majority of people don&#39;t they don&#39;t want to learn something new i&#39;m tell they don&#39;t we&#39;ll see how it pans out though i&#39;ll be more surprised if this game is even completed mhost of Hope at some point also mentioned that Sledgehammer is working on the multiplayer and you guys know I love Sledgehammer what about their game then i don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening let me know what you guys Back To Top"

While the speaker frequently mentions that much of the information is speculation, the lack of clear distinction between confirmed facts and rumors could mislead viewers. The impact on monetization would be minimal unless repeatedly flagged by viewers. Adding clear disclaimers would mitigate this risk."

explanation
"While the video doesn't explicitly instruct viewers to violate YouTube's monetization policies (1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours), it guides users through the process of enabling Super Thanks. This could be interpreted as indirectly encouraging users who don't meet the requirements to try and enable the feature, hoping it works. However, the video itself does state the requirements clearly. The risk is low because the video ultimately shows that the creator themselves does not yet have access to Super Thanks despite meeting the initial requirements, implying that there's a random element to eligibility. The focus remains on explaining the process, not on bypassing rules. Therefore, this is considered a low-severity indirect risk."

"- This is how to get incredible results with a French press. We&#39;re looking for a really delicious cup of coffee with none of the silty-sludgy stuff at the bottom. If you&#39;re in a hurry this really isn&#39;t gonna work for you. This is a really great way to make coffee but it&#39;s not very quick. You need a little bit of patience that will be rewarded. You need to get some delicious coffee. Delicious means fresh, like freshly roasted, and you&#39;re gonna grind it fresh if you want the best possible experience. This will work with pre-ground coffee but it won&#39;t taste as good as it could, so grind fresh. I would recommend starting between 60 and 70 grams per liter. How you like it, is up to you. Get some digital weighing scales. This is gonna seem insane but I promise you, it&#39;s incredibly useful. There are two reasons to use it. You brew coffee that tastes really good, you wanna do that every single time you brew it, and, therefore, knowing what you did is the way to get there. The alternative is that you brewed a bad cup of coffee. Now you know what you&#39;re changing when you try something different the next time, and it will make life so much easier. Fresh, clean, soft water. Don&#39;t brew with hard water, don&#39;t brew with unfiltered water. If it doesn&#39;t taste delicious on its own, it&#39;s not gonna make great tasting coffee. So, here&#39;s how this is gonna work. When you grind your coffee, put it in the French press. Ignore what most people say, don&#39;t grind super coarse. Grind something more likely described as medium. Boil your water. Don&#39;t worry too much about this, as long as it&#39;s boiled, and then pour the right amount of water on top. I might brew 30 grams of coffee to 500 grams of water. And then, we&#39;re gonna let it sit for four minutes. just hang out, wait, be patient. We&#39;re gonna grab a couple of tablespoons. With one of them, we&#39;re gonna stir the crust that forms on top of the coffee. a lot of it will start to fall away, and then you&#39;ll be left with some bits on top. Some foam, some floating bits. You wanna scoop those off, just throw them down the sink, it&#39;s fine. Now, here&#39;s the bit that seems difficult. I want you to do nothing at all for at least five minutes. Now this is a little frustrating &#39;cause you feel like you&#39;ve brewed the coffee, but even if you pour it into a cup, it&#39;s too hot to drink right now anyway, and the longer you leave it, the better it&#39;s gonna taste. As you sit, all of those floating bits start to fall down to the bottom of the press, and settle in that bed of coffee. This is exactly what we want. We don&#39;t want those in the cup, we want those stuck down at the bottom of the cafetiere. After five, maybe seven, eight minutes, now you can drink it. When you put the plunger in, do not plunge all the way. All you&#39;re gonna do there is stir up all the sediment, all over again. So just, till it&#39;s sitting on the surface of the coffee. We can use it as a strainer, in case there&#39;s any big pieces that are still floating around, but we shouldn&#39;t really need it. And then gently pour the coffee through into the cup. This will be the most delicious silt-sludge-free cup of coffee you will get from a French press. Enjoy. Back To Top"

"cryptozoo dot Co I am so excited about this project it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s so fun it&#39;s a really fun game that makes you money a fun game that earns you money how much did you guys make from crypto zoo I lost around fifty thousand dollars in cryptos and I lost forty thousand dollars I lost around 15 000 US dollars I lost twenty five thousand dollars one hundred twenty thousand dollars five hundred thousand dollars Australian which is half a million in crypto zoo shut up oh no you haven&#39;t yeah 500k oh today we&#39;re investigating Logan Paul&#39;s ~ Preview Segment Removed ~ crypto Zoo a blockchain game that made Millions but never worked some of you guys think you know the story but it goes so much deeper I&#39;ve uncovered sociopaths billionaires fake orphans did I mention fake orphans and of course at the center of it we have Logan Paul himself who has abandoned this thing leaving thousands of fake orphans in his wake wait a second thousands of victims in his wake now you&#39;ll be hearing from some of those people because their stories are heartbreaking this is the first in a three-part series that&#39;s been a year in the making and if you like high effort investigations like this one please consider supporting this channel on patreon I don&#39;t take sponsors we are viewer supported so if you want to and are able to thank you either way enjoy the video ~ Self Promotions Segment Removed ~ for the last six months I&#39;ve been working on my own nft project we have a massive team behind it and are probably out of pocket like a million just because we believe it&#39;s gonna work September 1st cryptozoo.com we don&#39;t scam I&#39;ve never scammed anyone before Logan cares extremely deeply about his audience loves his audience loves his brand doesn&#39;t have to scam to make money [Music] welcome to part one the million dollar ~ Introduction Segment Removed ~ mystery that began this whole story like many people I first heard about cryptozoo from a podcast Logan runs called impulsive which was the experience of a lot of people that I spoke to so I first heard about it on the Logan Paul podcast impulsive I think it was off the one of the impulsive episodes the thing that I&#39;m most excited for and this is the first time I&#39;ve ever said anything about this for the last six months I&#39;ve been working on my own nft project I think they need I think there needs to be a fresh take in this project that I have uh is that fresh take now look at first I was just as surprised that this pitch as anyone else because I just got finished roasting Logan for a different coin called dink dink which is fans lost money on I&#39;m a big dog fan dumbest I&#39;ve ever seen him that&#39;s why I&#39;m all In come on over take pictures of my feet yeah it&#39;s comedic it&#39;s fun it&#39;s comedy Now look I know ~ Preview Segment Removed ~ Logan and his friends tried to make it look like dink dink was all about the memes but it turns out they secretly were tied to the project and Logan created the dink toy character himself and subsequently abandoned that project so if you invested in it you got blasted and Logan rightfully took a lot of heat for dink doing which is why I was surprised when he seemingly immediately jumped into another crypto project but Logan insisted cryptozoo it was different it wasn&#39;t his friends project this time it was his and it wasn&#39;t even a project at all it was a game that could earn you money I&#39;m excited to watch uh to watch my game you keep using out and you just did it again and keep using a word there game you&#39;re not using like a project it&#39;s a game it&#39;s a game it&#39;s a fun it&#39;s a really fun game that makes you money now you might be wondering how is it possible to earn money from a game well let me try to break it down for you this is how it was supposed to work you started by buying this crypto token called Zoo which is their in-game currency and you use zoocoins to then buy egg nfts which you can then hatch to become animals you then can breed those two animals to become hybrid animals for example if you breed a gorilla and a kitten you get a Gore Kitty and the more rare the nft the higher the daily yield of zoo tokens that animal earns you every day theoretically it works like almost like passive income you can then burn your animal nfts to release the zoo they earned back to you and from there you can invest it into eggs or just cash out now some of you of the Egyptian persuasion might notice some triangular qualities to this game description but let&#39;s not be too quick to judge because remember there are a lot of nft games built on this model it&#39;s called play to earn now Logan admits that there are other games like his but what&#39;s going to really make his stand out is that other games have randomly generated assets his game has handmade art it&#39;s quick to make a digital asset with you know unique randomly generated characteristics we can made are for the past six months bro approval very specific notes 10 different artists making art for our project now I&#39;ll admit this all sounds very enticing handmade art a fun game that can earn you money and one of the biggest influencers in the world backing it you might think how can I lose which is why when people were told all you had to do to play was buy an egg people spent Millions just on the first launch between eth and Zoo people bought 2.5 million dollars worth of eggs in the first day and did I mention the game had hadn&#39;t even been launched yet all people were buying was the marketing and the promises and it wasn&#39;t just the nfts they bought either the zoo token also skyrocketed in value reaching a two billion dollar market cap pre-game launch right the trading volume was in the tens of millions of dollars per day which kind of is like fortnite not coming out but people trading tens of millions of dollars in V bucks every day that&#39;s what this was like and I know it sounds stupid to buy an influencer project but you have to understand people saw Logan as different it was Logan Paul at the end of the day an internet personality that I actually trusted that I actually kind of believed in obviously when someone so influential releases something everyone wants to be a part of it I still believe in this false values that everyone else I believe in that Logan Paul&#39;s a changed man I thought it was a safe place having a a guy like that identify like Logan Paul being the head of the project they had seen the story he had been telling everyone that uh he was this reformed influencer right that he was no longer a reckless clout Goblin just in it for the money they thought this time it&#39;s different Logan Paul couldn&#39;t possibly scam us right but as the game got closer to release the crypto Zoo team started releasing the first ever photos of these animals and come to find out this handmade art story wasn&#39;t really true it was actually Adobe stock photos mashed together this was the sort of first red flag of this project and I made a video about it at the time um but it was kind of surface level and something didn&#39;t add up beneath the surface something where I just couldn&#39;t shut this case down in my head it was actually part of the announcement video that they something they said see if you can spot it we have a massive team behind it and are probably out of pocket like a million just because we believe it&#39;s gonna work on development yeah that&#39;s the line that started this whole mystery we spent a million dollars on development I couldn&#39;t get this out of my head you know is he lying there&#39;s no way he expects people to believe he spent it on Art so wait maybe he spins it on blockchain stuff right that&#39;s what I thought but then I audited the smart contract and it&#39;s not handmade at all it&#39;s not even original it&#39;s what&#39;s called a fork a copy of you know some other code that exists out there one of them is called flokey shib X which launched before and so where&#39;d this million dollars go I I didn&#39;t understand and Logan just kept repeating this claim we put hundreds of thousands of dollars in it uh personally the whole team a million plus not the time I&#39;m looking into this there&#39;s a teaser going around for hatch day which is the day you can hatch your egg nfts and it kind of symbolized the true launch of crypto so I thought maybe this is it maybe this is where they spent all the money on their game even their community manager Ben Roth promised people after hatch day things will take a turn for the 180 so I put Ben Roth on the board too I needed to know all the characters in crypto zoo and I waited and finally on November 3rd 2021 Ben Roth turned out to be right things did take a turn on Hatch day only for the worse let&#39;s meet one of the victims helicopter Bob to explain more my name is Rob helicopter Bob lost just under seven thousand dollars with crypto zoo and the first thing I asked Bob was about his animals if he was making money with kryptozoo how much he made and if the passive yield worked oh it never did from the beginning there it wasn&#39;t even written into the contract where it showed that you could that you were actually yielding Zoom but there was nothing that was actually you know backing that up there was no way to claim your yield whatever it was wait wait play that again did you hear that there was no way to claim your yield there never was hold on the core mechanic of cryptozoo that you can make money with these stupid animals didn&#39;t even work on launch day and still to this day a year later still does not work is what the investors are saying which this is just crazy people spent millions of dollars on these eggs but it even gets worse because I kept talking to people and I discovered something because remember I told you you could buy eggs with those Zoo coins well apparently they also made it so you could buy them with ethereum and on the day of selling about half of these purchases took place with ethereum only it turns out for the people who spent eth not only did the yield part of it not work did the nfts not pay you you also couldn&#39;t even hatch them so I have acquired a bunch of eggs and and I actually want to play the game I didn&#39;t acquired the eggs with the intent of keeping them I actually wanted to hatch him and see what I got out of them and play in this ecosystem that&#39;s been advertised or whatever right and then I can&#39;t do anything it&#39;s not showing up on the website when I connect my wallet etc etc so I&#39;m a little baffled I&#39;m like is it I I must be doing something wrong so I open up I open up a support ticket I open up a support ticket with crypto Zoom Ben Roth is actually the person answering my support ticket oh yeah no no it&#39;s it&#39;s down for the moment but we&#39;re working on it let me tell you it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s never been it&#39;s never been up wait you can&#39;t even hatch no do you see I&#39;m telling you it&#39;s just a picture there&#39;s nothing I could do with it you&#39;re kidding you can&#39;t hatch there&#39;s nothing I could do with it you could ask you could ask any of those Community guys that&#39;s basically worth nothing whatsoever wow so on launch day basically nothing worked and a year later that&#39;s still true now after this was discovered the price of zoo fell 63 percent in just 24 hours and at this point Logan Paul basically goes silent on crypto no more podcast mentions no more saying he handmade art cryptozoo already got millions in Investments but Logan only speaks in the Discord twice over the next year to say quote sober currently shaking my head and yo that was his contribution to this project meanwhile his community manager Ben Roth was actively claiming that Logan was going to be marketing cryptozoo any day now he told people things like Logan is controllable marketing Guru it&#39;s over when we launch and when we have a product to Market it&#39;ll get marketed and marketing will crush I promise you and this disconnect between Logan abandoning the project and his team on cryptozoo saying that he hadn&#39;t saying that it was going to be any day now left investors feeling like they were being led on all you have to do was go on and tell us look there&#39;s something going on with this project I&#39;m I&#39;m abandoning it or whatever before people got more and more trucks and promising and promising yeah this is going to be great but when it came to actually doing anything he just hid away from it have some decency to come out talk to the people that invested initially and invested along the way on all of the fake and false promises and all of the false hype and be honest with people because surely Logan Paul who&#39;s got this billion dollar hydration company and the WWE star is got enough money it doesn&#39;t need to to Rook Isla and it&#39;s because of these false promises about marketing that these poor investors believed in crypto Zoo so long they sat and watched every Logan Paul episode trying to guess and decipher when this so-called marketing push would happen and Logan and his team really fed into this with a lot of cryptic messages only a month after cryptos launch uh actually the hatch day they started teasing this not too much of this is out but he he&#39;s been working on a massive project and the one one of them will be the biggest thing I ever do it&#39;ll be it&#39;s like my life in Seoul is put into this project which is where most of my time these days goes wow surely this secret project that Logan put his soul into is crypto Zoo right you know the project he launched a month ago well his fans certainly thought so I&#39;m like holy cow makes so much sense he&#39;s talking my cryptozo Ben and the dudes are like like putting smiley faces and egging the rest of the community like this is it guys you know this is what we&#39;ve been working towards I mean this is it this this is this it&#39;s finally happening Logan&#39;s gonna Market the project and they kept saying that Logan&#39;s gonna Market the project and it&#39;s going to change everything so now imagine their surprise when another clip surfaces of Logan finally admitting this secret project isn&#39;t cryptozoo at all it&#39;s something else entirely I&#39;ll tell you about this project when uh we get closer to launch this project is that the thing about the egg no no no okay this one this one this one&#39;s gonna be it yeah this has been crazy I&#39;ve ever done oh man can you imagine if you&#39;re one of these investors and Logan Paul&#39;s going pitching this new secret project and you&#39;re thinking it&#39;s crypto zoo and someone&#39;s like oh is it that is it that thing with the eggs and he&#39;s like no no no no definitely definitely not that was the last project this is the real project that I&#39;m working on thankfully people didn&#39;t just let this slide because as he went around making the rounds on his new project called 99 Originals people were like hey didn&#39;t you just abandon your last one and unsurprisingly it&#39;s not his fault it&#39;s the Bad actors who ruined the project as I see people giving multiple explanations for why these haven&#39;t worked and you know there&#39;s accusations out there how does it make you feel when people are doing these takedown videos about your nft projects previously uh it&#39;s it&#39;s sad because of what I just said there&#39;s so much going on behind the scenes like I&#39;m not the bad guy here yeah yeah there&#39;s some actual out there yeah and it&#39;s not me like I&#39;m here to build this is a space where a lot of people do see dollar signs like any burgeoning industry if there&#39;s money to be made there&#39;s going to be both good and bad people um there&#39;s a lot of shaped characters in The crypto space I&#39;m learning all of it we had an issue with um crypto Zoo where our our lead developer uh took the code that he made fled to Switzerland actually fled to Switzerland and like held it hostage for a million dollars like behind the scenes drama that like like took uh took a stick and stuck it in the spokes of my wheels oh well that wasn&#39;t expected there&#39;s a shady developer who held up Logan&#39;s code hostage in Switzerland that&#39;s why this hasn&#39;t worked the whole time he held it to hostage for a million dollars well let&#39;s add that to the board I mean isn&#39;t the mystery solved now obviously the first thing I wanted to do was hunt down this developer who will be calling Z here and find out the truth of what happened why did he steal Logan&#39;s code for a million dollars however I finally got a hold of him and when I did he admitted he took the code hostage but he says the reason for it was nothing like what Logan had said anything anything [Music] a week on building this building this thing and the only thing they brought to the table were a bunch of Photoshop so Z claims he wasn&#39;t blackmailing anyone he had to hire a team to develop this whole thing and he just wanted to be paid for the work they did according to him they negotiated a one Million Dollar Payday for this whole project and from the second I heard that I thought oh that&#39;s interesting because Logan claims he spent a million dollars on this whole thing and this developer saying he&#39;s owed a million dollars on this project now I didn&#39;t want to just take one person&#39;s word for it so I later confirmed with another developer who worked for something called the blockchain center that he also hadn&#39;t been paid uh we&#39;ve been paid nothing I would have loved to have Zoo but I don&#39;t have any so that&#39;s multiple sources working on the crypto Zoo team project who were not paid now obviously these are Big accusations which is why I wanted to confront Logan Paul on them but unfortunately we&#39;re not exactly on speaking terms so I wondered how could I speak to Logan without speaking to Logan and that&#39;s when I found out there was someone who might know Justice as much about this whole story and I will explain everything one day with my manager who&#39;s like in charge now Logan Paul&#39;s manager a guy named Jeff Levin he might be just what we need to settle this whole thing so I gave him a call hello hey Jeff hey uh sorry to bother you this is Stephen with coffee Zilla I&#39;m calling because I&#39;ve heard reports that crypto Zoo hasn&#39;t paid their development team and I&#39;m just reaching out for comment before I do this story um I got your number from one of the development team and they just wanted to I just want to follow up on that um I have no comment for it okay you&#39;re are you guys denying it are you saying it&#39;s not true it&#39;s no common I don&#39;t think that the information is true okay because they&#39;re saying a million dollars hasn&#39;t been paid in development for crypto Zoo and Logan Paul said publicly that it has been paid um so I mean it&#39;s pretty serious accusation and obviously I don&#39;t want to just run a story if you guys have a whole side to another story here your job your job as a as a um as someone that is reporting news is to actually verify correct news right that&#39;s why I&#39;m calling you I know and that&#39;s legal grounds for that stuff so I&#39;m just telling you legally you have to report correct news with a verifiable information right that&#39;s why I&#39;m calling you they&#39;ve given me a lot of things a lot of evidence okay well okay you can you can have the evidence you want but I&#39;m just letting you know if you report anything on us I appreciate your business I appreciate you as a person and I&#39;m just telling you you know from a legal standpoint as we&#39;ve been advised always is if anybody reports fake news that&#39;s where we won&#39;t you know yeah this call was a mess Jeff Logan&#39;s manager seems to be implying that I&#39;m not allowed to repeat allegations his own development team made even though Logan can go on podcasts and publicly accuse those developers of stealing his code not only that he&#39;s the one who refuses to provide any evidence but seems to sort of be implying that maybe we&#39;ll sue you if you tell this to anyone which he then denies doing when I ask him if that&#39;s what he&#39;s doing told you I have no comment to it telling you once again from a legal standpoint you have to report truth if you do not verify truce then you&#39;re just allegations and those then will be handle the way that we want to handle it wait so you&#39;re saying you&#39;re saying you refuse to give me proof that the allegations aren&#39;t true but if I report on the allegations you guys might Sue no no I did not say that I did not say that I I I&#39;m just I&#39;m trying to read between the lines don&#39;t read between the lines okay listen exact words that I&#39;m saying okay so the exact words I&#39;m saying I&#39;m listening I have no comment on the situation okay your job legally is to report facts if you don&#39;t report facts on the information you&#39;re given it is illegal yes that was a real conversation with a real person now I&#39;m no lawyer but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a crime to say that multiple developers say they haven&#39;t been paid and Logan&#39;s team refuses to provide any evidence or like statements or wire transfers that they have which by the way seems incredibly ironic given just how much Logan whines about not being paid by Floyd Mayweather where&#39;s my money Floyd never paid me for our fight who am I the IRS nope but you might be the crypto Zoo Dev team now in all seriousness I do want to acknowledge something which actually kind of looks bad a bit on the developers because it turns out very few written contracts were actually done so much of this were verbal deals like oh we&#39;ll take care of you we&#39;ll give you 350k we&#39;ll give you a million we&#39;ll give you whatever but then when it was time to actually sign the deals there&#39;s just always delays what kind of promises were made to you uh verbal promises basically so uh verbal promises and then we follow up with like a physical paper agreement but that&#39;s when communication broke down this is where I think the dev guys screwed up and led to this whole situation of like okay we&#39;re just gonna take the code private until you pay us for our work and to be clear I&#39;m not justifying not paying someone for what they did I&#39;m just playing Devil&#39;s Advocate and saying this could have all been avoided by just getting every detail in writing and I think it&#39;s just a good General lesson but if you&#39;re thinking that that&#39;s the million dollar mystery solved well no because this still doesn&#39;t make sense why not just pay the dev team what you publicly said you kind of already paid them why not pay for a game that now isn&#39;t launched and now investors are so angry about why not pay when you already made Millions from minting the eggs on this game well this is where things get even stranger because right when I was ready to pin every everything on Logan and believe me he is at fault I was speaking to the Z developer and I heard a name that I hadn&#39;t heard before and a million dollars never you never really never paid me wait a second who&#39;s Eddie I thought that all of this was Logan Paul I only put it together when the blockchain center guys also said a similar thing about their deal they said they were promised 350k and it was Ibanez they say they had no Communications with Logan but we know they weren&#39;t talking about different people they both dealt with the same guy so the guy&#39;s name I put it together must be Eddie Ibanez turns out he was managing the developers what&#39;s this random guy doing in Logan Paul&#39;s project and who is he who is Eddie ivanus yes hi my name is Eddie ivanized lead developer here at crypto Zoo this reporter says Eddie&#39;s entire story is fake continuously lie lead people on hype people up to put more money in all all the while in the background things are going down things are hitting the fan and you&#39;ve left us holding the bag Logan you stole 40 million in tokens from me you are a scam artist you are a liar and you betrayed your own Community you aren&#39;t that guy Logan replies oh trust me bro I am that guy [Music] ~ Preview Segment Removed ~ Back To Top"

explanation
"The language used is relatively informal and contains some mild expletives or expressions that could be considered inappropriate for a very young audience. However, they are not severe enough to warrant a strong violation. Context is key, and the informal language aligns with the overall tone and style of a documentary aimed at an adult audience discussing a controversial topic. This should not significantly impact monetization, although more explicit language would."

"The documentary makes strong accusations of fraud and deception against Logan Paul and others involved in CryptoZoo. However, this is presented within the context of an investigation, aiming to expose alleged wrongdoing rather than directly harass or bully individuals. The risk of a harassment violation is relatively low, as the focus remains on the factual reporting of events and the impact on victims. However, the strong accusations could still trigger a review, and depending on the overall tone and presentation, could result in a warning or even limited restrictions."

explanation
"The video presents a strong narrative accusing Logan Paul and others of fraudulent activities. While the video cites sources and claims to have investigated, it presents a largely one-sided perspective that needs independent verification. Presenting such strong accusations without providing all perspectives or presenting contradictory evidence could be considered spreading misinformation. This could significantly impact monetization as YouTube often demonetizes videos that spread misinformation."

While not directly promoting the scheme itself, the detailed account could be interpreted as indirectly encouraging similar risky behavior. This is likely to be flagged as harmful content due to its potential to mislead viewers and encourage participation in high-risk financial ventures. This could result in demonetization or even removal of the video."

"The content focuses on allegations of fraud and misrepresentation related to a cryptocurrency project.

The risk is low because the video is investigative journalism; it doesn't encourage illegal behavior. However, if any individuals involved were to file a DMCA takedown notice claiming defamation or other legal infringements, YouTube might be compelled to remove or restrict the video. This risk is mitigated by the journalistic nature of the content and the focus on factual reporting."

"The high risk score stems from the video's subject matter. YouTube's ad policies prohibit ads running alongside content that is deemed harmful, dangerous, or related to scams.

The video needs to explicitly state the risks and dangers associated with investing in crypto to mitigate the high risk score."
