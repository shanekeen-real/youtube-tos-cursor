    IMPORTANT: Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any commentary, explanation, or text outside the JSON object.
    CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES:
    - All string values MUST escape any double quotes inside them as \\\".
    - Do NOT use unescaped double quotes inside any string value.
    - Do NOT include comments or extra textâ€”output ONLY valid JSON.
    - Example: "text": "This is a string with an escaped quote: \\\"example\\\"."
    - If a string contains a newline, escape it as \\n.
    Generate specific, actionable suggestions to improve the following content based on the analysis:
    Content: "${text}"
    Policy Analysis: ${JSON.stringify(policyAnalysis, null, 2)}
    Risk Assessment: ${JSON.stringify(riskAssessment, null, 2)}
    All suggestions should be phrased as advice or recommendations (e.g., 'It is advised to...', 'Consider...', 'We recommend...'), not as direct commands. Avoid imperative language.
    You MUST provide between 5-12 actionable suggestions for every scan, regardless of risk level. If the content is very safe, include tips for growth, engagement, monetization, or best practices.
    CRITICAL: Do NOT exceed 12 suggestions. Focus on the most important and actionable recommendations.
    Provide suggestions in JSON format:
    {
      "suggestions": [
        {
          "title": "string (suggestion title)",
          "text": "string (detailed explanation)",
          "priority": "HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW",
          "impact_score": "number (0-100, how much this will improve the content)"
        }
      ]
    }
    Focus on practical, implementable changes that will reduce policy violations and improve monetization potential.
    AGAIN: Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include any commentary, explanation, or text outside the JSON object.
